abstract = {In June 1999, after devastating coral bleaching in 1998, laboratory fertilization of Acropora nasuta, one of the most abundant reef-building corals in Okinawa, Japan, decreased significantly from usual rates (>94%) to an average uf 42% at a sperm concentration of 10(5) ml(-1). Similar decreases were observed in four other mass-spawning acroporid corals. We also found a decrease in sperm motility in the laboratory. A series of experiments to determine the effects of sperm concentration on fertilization rates revealed that sperm of 10(7) ml(-1) was needed to obtain a rate >80%. Sperm concentration in surface seawater during mass spawning was highest within 1.0 h of spawning but decreased sharply thereafter These results suggest that gamete dilution plays an important role in limiting the fertilization of coral eggs in the yea. As successful fertilization appears to have been much lower in 1999, we suspect that production of new coral recruits was also reduced greatly. Current and future sea-temperature increases thus pose a severe potential threat to coral reefs by increasing the frequency of coral bleaching and consequently leading to further declines of coral recruitment and hence, reef corals.},

abstract = {The response of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillatato short-term (min to h) and long-term (d) exposure to reduced-salinity seawater was examined. Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to assess the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic dinoflagellates (dark-adapted Fv/Fm) in the coral tissues (in hospite) before, during and after exposure. Exposure to reduced-salinity seawater caused a marked reduction in efficiency (the ratio of variable [Fv] to maximal [Fm] fluorescence), and there was an apparent link between a reduction in dark-adapted Fv/Fmand a loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates from the corals. The reduction in Fv/Fmof the symbiotic algae and subsequent dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis (coral bleaching) occurred during exposure to reduced-salinity seawater in either the light or dark. The results demonstrate that bleaching in response to low-salinity seawater is a truly sublethal response, contrary to a recent suggestion. The study also suggests that bleaching of corals in response to low-salinity seawater may not involve the passive loss of algal symbionts and that an impairment of the capacity of the algal symbionts for photosynthesis represents a common {\textquoteleft}cue{\textquoteright} initiating the dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis during exposure to sub-optimal conditions. This study demonstrates how ex- 
posure to low-salinity seawater alone can cause some of the symptoms commonly attributed to temperature anomalies and anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs. },

abstract = {The light dependency of respiratory activity of two scleractinian corals was examined using O 2 microsensors and CO 2 exchange measurements. Light respiration increased strongly but asymptotically with elevated irradiance in both species. Light respiration in Pocillopora damicornis was higher than in Pavona decussata under low irradiance, indicating species-specific differences in light-dependent metabolic processes. Overall, the coral P. decussata exhibited higher CO 2 uptake rates than P. damicornis over the experimental irradiance range. P. decussata also harboured twice as many algal symbionts and higher total protein biomass compared to P. damicornis , possibly resulting in self-shading of the symbionts and/or changes in host tissue specific light distribution. Differences in light respiration and CO 2 availability could be due to host-specific characteristics that modulate the symbiont microenvironment, its photosynthesis, and hence the overall performance of the coral holobiont.},

In addition to the latest developments in coral evolution and physiology, it presents chapters devoted to novel frontiers in coral reef research. These include the molecular biology of corals and their symbiotic algae, remote sensing of reef systems, ecology of coral disease spread, effects of various scenarios of global climate change, ocean acidification effects of increasing CO2 levels on coral calcification, and damaged coral reef remediation. Beyond extensive coverage of the above aspects, key issues regarding the coral organism and the reef ecosystem such as calcification, reproduction, modeling, algae, reef invertebrates, competition and fish are re-evaluated in the light of new research and emerging insights. In all chapters novel theories as well as challenges to established paradigms are introduced, evaluated and discussed. This volume is indispensible for all those involved in coral reef management and conservation.},

In membrane patches excised from mammalian central neurons, the endogenous tyrosine kinase Src was shown to regulate the activity of NMDA channels. The action of Src required a sequence [Src(40-58)] within the noncatalytic, unique domain of Src. In addition, Src coprecipitated with NMDA receptor proteins. Finally, endogenous Src regulated the function of NMDA receptors at synapses. Thus, NMDA receptor regulation by Src may be important in development, plasticity, and pathology in the CNS.},

abstract = {Photo-acclimation dynamics of the symbiotic coral Stylophora pistillata to lowering light intensities in the range of 95% to 0.8% of incident surface photosynthetic active radiation (PAR(o)) was studied. Coral colonies were sampled from 1- to 2-m depths in open and shaded habitats from the fringing reef of Sesoko Island (near the Tropical Biosphere Research Center, University of the Ryukyus) Okinawa, Japan. Photo-acclimation of exterior branches of coral colonies were examined in outdoor aquarium, where light regime and feeding were similar to field conditions. Two photo-acclimation reactions were studied (1) changes in chlorophyll concentrations in zooxanthellae; (2) changes in zooxanthellar population density in coral branches. In parallel, we measured an average volume of zooxanthellae, proliferating zooxanthellae frequency (PZF) and degrading zooxanthellae frequency (DZF). It was shown that the coral S. pistillata can survive and acclimate to a wide range of light intensities from 95% to 0.8% PAR(o). Acclimation to low light (30% and 8% PAR(o)) involves maximizing the light harvesting capacity by increasing photosynthetic pigment concentration in zooxanthellae and zooxanthellar population density in coral branches. Under extremely low light (0.8% PAR(o)), the coral lost zooxanthellae by degradation (perhaps digestion) and retained zooxanthellae-accumulated high concentrations of chlorophyll. The photoacclimation process is dynamic and immediate. Changes in pigment concentrations in zooxanthellae occurred within 2-4 days and changes in zooxanthellar population densities occurred within 40 days. Zooxanthellae population densities were regulated by changes in rates of division and degradation of symbiotic cells. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Redox signaling provides a quick and efficient mechanism for clonal or colonial organisms to adapt their growth and development to aspects of the environment, e.g. the food supply. A 'signature' of mitochondrial redox signaling, particularly as mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), can be elucidated by experimental manipulation of the electron transport chain. The major sites of ROS formation are found at NADH dehydrogenase of complex I and at the interface between coenzyme Q and complex III. Inhibitors of complex III should thus upregulate ROS from both sites; inhibitors of complex I should upregulate ROS from the first but not the second site, while uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation should downregulate ROS from both sites. To investigate the possibility of such redox signaling, perturbations of colony growth and development were carried out using the hydroid Podocoryna carnea. Oxygen uptake of colonies was measured to determine comparable physiological doses of antimycin A(1) (an inhibitor of complex III), rotenone (an inhibitor of complex I) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation). Using these doses, clear effects on colony growth and development were obtained. Treatment with antimycin A(1) results in 'runner-like' colony growth, with widely spaced polyps and stolon branches, while treatment with CCCP results in 'sheet-like' growth, with closely spaced polyps and stolon branches. Parallel results have been obtained previously with azide, an inhibitor of complex IV, and dinitrophenol, another uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Perhaps surprisingly, rotenone produced effects on colony development similar to those of CCCP. Assays of peroxides using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and fluorescent microscopy suggest a moderate difference in ROS formation between the antimycin and rotenone treatments. The second site of ROS formation (the interface between coenzyme Q and complex III) may thus predominate in the signaling that regulates colony development. The fat-rich, brine shrimp diet of these hydroids may be relevant in this context. Acyl CoA dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the first step in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids, carries electrons to coenzyme Q, thus bypassing complex I. These results support a role for redox signaling, mediated by ROS, in colony development. Nevertheless, other redox sensors between complexes I and III may yet be found.},

The algae were exposed to UV in the presence of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in culture and in hospite, and their responses compared to cells exposed to PAR only. Exposure to UV affected the size of neither S. californium nor S. microadriaticum, but growth rates in culture were significantly reduced under the influence of UV in the former, but not the latter. Synthesis of chlorophylls a and c(2) was depressed by UV in S. microadriaticum, but not in S. californium. UV-depressed cell motility in culture in both species. While S. microadriaticum showed no obvious morphological responses to UV in culture or in hospite, S. californium in culture developed multiple-layered cell walls after 4-wk exposure to UV, and this phenomenon disappeared after the cells were returned to culture conditions in the absence of UV. The production of multiple cell walls was not observed in hospite.},

These new methods have expanded previously focused readouts from a variety of DNA preparation protocols to a genome-wide scale and have fine-tuned their resolution to single base precision. The sequencing of RNA also has transitioned and now includes full-length cDNA analyses, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)-based methods, and noncoding RNA discovery. Next-generation sequencing has also enabled novel applications such as the sequencing of ancient DNA samples, and has substantially widened the scope of metagenomic analysis of environmentally derived samples. Taken together, an astounding potential exists for these technologies to bring enormous change in genetic and biological research and to enhance our fundamental biological knowledge.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Divergent natural selection across environmental gradients has been acknowledged as a major driver of population and species divergence, however its role in the diversification of scleractinian corals remains poorly understood. Recently, it was demonstrated that the brooding coral Seriatopora hystrix and its algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) are genetically partitioned across reef environments (0-30 m) on the far northern Great Barrier Reef. Here, we explore the potential mechanisms underlying this differentiation and assess the stability of host-symbiont associations through a reciprocal transplantation experiment across habitats ('Back Reef', 'Upper Slope' and 'Deep Slope'), in combination with molecular (mtDNA and ITS2-DGGE) and photo-physiological analyses (respirometry and HPLC).

RESULTS:The highest survival rates were observed for native transplants (measured 14 months after transplantation), indicating differential selective pressures between habitats. Host-symbiont assemblages remained stable during the experimental duration, demonstrating that the ability to "shuffle" or "switch" symbionts is restricted in S. hystrix. Photo-physiological differences were observed between transplants originating from the shallow and deep habitats, with indirect evidence of an increased heterotrophic capacity in native deep-water transplants (from the 'Deep Slope' habitat). Similar photo-acclimatisation potential was observed between transplants originating from the two shallow habitats ('Back Reef' and 'Upper Slope'), highlighting that their genetic segregation over depth may be due to other, non-photo-physiological traits under selection.

CONCLUSIONS:This study confirms that the observed habitat partitioning of S. hystrix (and associated Symbiodinium) is reflective of adaptive divergence along a depth gradient. Gene flow appears to be reduced due to divergent selection, highlighting the potential role of ecological mechanisms, in addition to physical dispersal barriers, in the diversification of scleractinian corals and their associated Symbiodinium.},

abstract = {Sea anemones (Phylum Cnidaria; Class Anthozoa, Order Actiniaria) exhibit a diversity of developmental patterns that include cloning by fission. Because natural histories of clonal and aclonal sea anemones are quite different, the gain and loss of fission is an important feature of actiniarian lineages. We have used mitochondrial DNA and nuclear intron DNA phylogenies to investigate the evolution of longitudinal fission in sixteen species in the genus Anthopleura, and reconstructed an aclonal ancestor that has given rise at least four times to clonal descendents. For A. elegantissima from the northeastern Pacific Ocean, a transition to clonality by fission was associated with an up-shore habitat shift, supporting prior hypotheses that clonal growth is an adaptation to the upper shore. Fission in Actiniaria likely precedes its advent in Anthopleura, and its repeated loss and gain is perplexing. Field studies of the acontiate sea anemone Aiptasia californica provided insight to the mechanisms that regulate fission: subtidal Aiptasia responded to experimentally destabilized substrata by increasing rates of pedal laceration. We put forth a general hypothesis for actiniarian fission in which sustained tissue stretch (a consequence of substratum instability or intrinsic behavior) induces tissue degradation, which in turn induces regeneration. The gain and loss of fission in Anthopleura lineages may only require the gain and loss of some form of stretching behavior. In this view, tissue stretch initiates a cascade of developmental events without requiring complex gene regulatory linkages.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals occur as a range of colour morphs because of varying types and concentrations of pigments within the host tissues, but little is known about their physiological or ecological significance. Here, we examined whether specific host pigments act as an alternative mechanism for photoacclimation in the coral holobiont. We used the coral Montipora monasteriata (Forskal 1775) as a case study because it occurs in multiple colour morphs (tan, blue, brown, green and red) within varying light-habitat distributions. We demonstrated that two of the non-fluorescent host pigments are responsive to changes in external irradiance, with some host pigments up-regulating in response to elevated irradiance. This appeared to facilitate the retention of antennal chlorophyll by endosymbionts and hence, photosynthetic capacity. Specifically, net P-max Chl a(-1) correlated strongly with the concentration of an orange-absorbing non-fluorescent pigment (CP-580). This had major implications for the energetics of bleached blue-pigmented (CP-580) colonies that maintained net P-max cm(-2) by increasing P-max Chl a(-1). The data suggested that blue morphs can bleach, decreasing their symbiont populations by an order of magnitude without compromising symbiont or coral health.},

abstract = {Approximately one quarter of zooxanthellate coral species have a depth distribution from shallow waters (<30 m) down to mesophotic depths of 30-60 m. The deeper populations of such species are less likely to be affected by certain environmental perturbations, including high temperature/high irradiance causing coral bleaching. This has led to the hypothesis that deep populations may serve as refuges and a source of recruits for shallow reef habitats. The extent of vertical connectivity of reef coral species, however, is largely unquantified. Using 10 coral host microsatellite loci and sequences of the host mtDNA putative control region, as well as ribosomal DNA (rDNA) ITS2 sequences of the coral's algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium), we examine population structure, connectivity and symbiont specificity in the brooding coral Seriatopora hystrix across a depth profile in both northwest (Scott Reef) and northeast Australia (Yonge Reef). Strong genetic structuring over depth was observed in both regions based on the microsatellite loci; however, Yonge Reef exhibited an additional partitioning of mtDNA lineages (associated with specific symbiont ITS2 types), whereas Scott Reef was dominated by a single mtDNA lineage (with no apparent host-symbiont specificity). Evidence for recruitment of larvae of deep water origin into shallow habitats was found at Scott Reef, suggesting that recovery of shallow water habitats may be aided by migration from deep water refuges. Conversely, no migration from the genetically divergent deep slope populations into the shallow habitats was evident at Yonge Reef, making recovery of shallow habitats from deeper waters at this location highly unlikely.},

abstract = {The symbiosis between host cnidarians, such as corals and anemones, and their dinoflagellate symbionts is regulated by largely undescribed mechanisms that stabilize the symbiosis during normal conditions but lead to symbiosis breakdown, or cnidarian bleaching, during stress. Previous transcriptomic studies identified the sphingosine rheostat as a putative symbiosis regulatory pathway. The sphingosine rheostat, which includes the sphingolipids sphingosine (Sph) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), is a key homeostatic cell regulatory pathway known to function in cell fate and immunity in animals. This study explores the role of sphingosine rheostat components in the stability of the symbiotic partnership. The anemone Aiptasia pallida, host to the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium sp., was used to test the hypothesis that S1P promotes symbiosis stability whereas Sph increases bleaching induced by heat stress. Anemones pre-incubated in exogenous S1P and FTY720, a synthetic S1P analog, were partially rescued from heat-stress-induced bleaching. In addition, they displayed a decrease in caspase activity, a measure of apoptosis, compared to controls. In contrast, when anemones were pre-incubated with Sph, both bleaching and caspase activity increased compared to untreated, heat-stressed controls. These data suggest that the sphingosine rheostat may play a role in the balance between stability and dysfunction in cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses.},

abstract = {Acroporids and tridacnids are common components of Akajima reef in Okinawa, Japan, where extensive bleaching and death of corals were recorded in 1998 in association with anomalously-high summer temperatures. To evaluate the dynamics and possible role of symbiotic dinoflagellates in the susceptibility of symbiotic reef organisms to bleaching, the dinoflagellate symbionts of the stony coral Acropora digitifera and the tridacnid clam Tridacna in Akajima reef were monitored over four seasons of 1999. A. digitifera and Tridacna were found to host at least 2 genetically-diverse populations of the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, based on denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence comparison of the hypervariable region of the algae{\textquoteright}s 18S rRNA gene. Measurement of the symbionts{\textquoteright} Chl a content and
density from replicate coral colonies and clams in replicate plots and weeks of sampling showed no significant seasonal bleaching and differences in algal growth. Initial assessment of the mixed algal populations of A. digitifera and Tridacna
showed general consistency over the different seasons. The year 1999 was a typical year with no anomalous temperature changes on the reef, based on the daily temperature record of the Akajima Marine Science Laboratory. These findings
suggest that no significant seasonal bleaching and algal population shifts occur in some acroporids and tridacnids during a typical year with respect to temperature. This constitutes important baseline information on algal population dynamics in reef invertebrates.},

abstract = {Novel high-throughput sequencing methods outperform earlier approaches in terms of resolution and magnitude. They enable identification and relative quantification of community members and offer new insights into fungal community ecology. These methods are currently taking over as the primary tool to assess fungal communities of plant-associated endophytes, pathogens, and mycorrhizal symbionts, as well as free-living saprotrophs. Taking advantage of the collective experience of six research groups, we here review the different stages involved in fungal community analysis, from field sampling via laboratory procedures to bioinformatics and data interpretation. We discuss potential pitfalls, alternatives, and solutions. Highlighted topics are challenges involved in: obtaining representative DNA/RNA samples and replicates that encompass the targeted variation in community composition, selection of marker regions and primers, options for amplification and multiplexing, handling of sequencing errors, and taxonomic identification. Without awareness of methodological biases, limitations of markers, and bioinformatics challenges, large-scale sequencing projects risk yielding artificial results and misleading conclusions.},

abstract = {Oceanic bacteria perform many environmental functions, including biogeochemical cycling of many elements, metabolizing of greenhouse gases, functioning in oceanic food webs (microbial loop), and producing valuable natural products and viruses. We demonstrate that the widespread capability of marine bacteria to participate in horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in coastal and oceanic environments may be the result of gene transfer agents (GTAs), viral-like particles produced by $\alpha$-Proteobacteria. We documented GTA-mediated gene transfer frequencies a thousand to a hundred million times higher than prior estimates of HGT in the oceans, with as high as 47% of the culturable natural microbial community confirmed as gene recipients. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which marine bacteria acquire novel traits, thus ensuring resilience in the face of environmental change.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of a hereditary symbiosis requires testing how ecological factors alter not only the fitness consequences of the symbiosis, but also the rate of symbiont transmission to the next generation. The relative importance of these two mechanisms remains unresolved because studies have not simultaneously examined how the ecological context of the symbiosis influences both costs/benefits and the rate of vertical transmission. Fungal endophytes in grasses have provided particularly tractable systems for investigating the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of hereditary symbiosis. Here we examine interactions between a fungal endophyte. Epichloe amarillans, and its grass host, Agrostis hyemalis, under altered abiotic and biotic contexts: a gradient of water availability and in the presence versus absence of soil microbes. We show that benefits of the symbiosis were strongest when water was limiting. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level produced similar to 40% more inflorescences and greater seed mass than non-symbiotic plants, while at the highest watering level, symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants did not significantly differ in reproductive fitness. Benefits appear to accrue by allowing hosts to escape from drought, a response that has not been previously reported to be endophyte-mediated. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level flowered 9 days earlier than non-symbiotic plants. Interestingly, our results suggest the symbiosis may be costly in the presence of soil microbes, as on live soil, the biomass of symbiotic plants was lower than the biomass of symbiont-free plants. We detected no effect of either the biotic or abiotic context on the rate of symbiont vertical transmission, suggesting that the context-dependent benefits of the symbiosis are the more important driver of variation in symbiont frequency in this system.

abstract = {We studied the relation of light with coral colony morphology and coral distribution over a 5 to 50 m reef slope. We describe the characteristics of 6 species of the genus Madracis in relation to the light (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]: 400 to 700 nm) colonies receive at a small spatial scale (1 to 10 cm). Species differ in their response to light but we could distinguish 3 strategies: (1) Species strive for maximum light capture and colonies occur above a threshold light value. This limits the distribution of such species toward greater depths. These species are found in shallow (<15 m) water and their morphological variation is not related to variation in the amount of light they receive, (2) Species strive for maximum light capture but all colonies occur below a threshold light value. Such species occur only on the deeper parts (>30 m) of the reef slope. Colony morphological variation is also unrelated to variation in the amount of light the colonies receive, (3) Species prefer low light habitats. Such species are found over the entire reef slope and they show a bimodal light preference. One part of the population (1st mode) prefers the maximum amount of light available at a particular depth. The other part of the population (2nd mode) prefers cryptic habitats with low light levels (5 to 60 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1)). In these species, morphological variation in colony shape relates to light availability. Structural complexity of the reef surface within the same depth causes such variation in local light availability. This variation ranges between the maximum value at a depth predicted by physical laws and the minimal values encountered in cryptic habitats, The large variation in available light occurring over spatial scales as small as 10 cm distorts the direct relation between depth and light. Depth and light are only correlated as ecological factors for species that strive for maximum light capture (Strategy 1 or 2). A large depth distribution does not imply adaptation to a large light range when species have a strict preference for cryptic light environments. For such species (Strategy 3) depth is not a proxy for light, The different light strategies of species are related to morphological variation and species exploration of the reef habitat.},

abstract = {Most known starfish species possess a compound eye at the tip of each arm, which, except for the lack of true optics, resembles an arthropod compound eye. Although these compound eyes have been known for about two centuries, no visually guided behaviour has ever been directly associated with their presence. There are indications that they are involved in negative phototaxis but this may also be governed by extraocular photoreceptors. Here, we show that the eyes of the coral-reef-associated starfish Linckia laevigata are slow and colour blind. The eyes are capable of true image formation although with low spatial resolution. Further, our behavioural experiments reveal that only specimens with intact eyes can navigate back to their reef habitat when displaced, demonstrating that this is a visually guided behaviour. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a function of starfish compound eyes. We also show that the spectral sensitivity optimizes the contrast between the reef and the open ocean. Our results provide an example of an eye supporting only low-resolution vision, which is believed to be an essential stage in eye evolution, preceding the high-resolution vision required for detecting prey, predators and conspecifics.},

abstract = {Microscopic and cytological evidence suggest that many dinoflagellates possess a haploid nuclear phase. However, the ploidy of a number of dinoflagellates remains unknown, and molecular genetic support for haploidy in this group has been lacking. To elucidate the ploidy of symbiotic dinollagellates belonging to the genus Symbiodinium, we used five polymorphic microsatellites to examine populations harbored by the Caribbean gorgonians Plexaura kuna and Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae; we also studied a series of Symbiodinium cultures. In 690 out of 728 Symbiodinium samples in hospite (95% of the cases) and in all 45 Symbiodinium cultures, only a single allele was recovered per locus. Statistical testing of the Symbiodinium populations harbored by P. elisabethae revealed that the observed genotype frequencies deviate significantly from those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Taken together, our results confirm that, in the vegetative life stage, members of Symbiodinium, both cultured and in hospite, are haploid. Furthermore, based on the phylogenetics of the dinoflagellates, haploidy in vegetative cells appears to be an ancestral trait that extends to all 2000 extant species of these important unicellular protists.},

abstract = {The recent introduction of massively parallel pyrosequencers allows rapid, inexpensive analysis of microbial community composition using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences. However, a major challenge is to design a workflow so that taxonomic information can be accurately and rapidly assigned to each read, so that the composition of each community can be linked back to likely ecological roles played by members of each species, genus, family or phylum. Here, we use three large 16S rRNA datasets to test whether taxonomic information based on the full-length sequences can be recaptured by short reads that simulate the pyrosequencer outputs. We find that different taxonomic assignment methods vary radically in their ability to recapture the taxonomic information in full-length 16S rRNA sequences: most methods are sensitive to the region of the 16S rRNA gene that is targeted for sequencing, but many combinations of methods and rRNA regions produce consistent and accurate results. To process large datasets of partial 16S rRNA sequences obtained from surveys of various microbial communities, including those from human body habitats, we recommend the use of Greengenes or RDP classifier with fragments of at least 250 bases, starting from one of the primers R357, R534, R798, F343 or F517.},

abstract = {The genetic composition of the resident Symbiodinium endosymbionts can strongly modulate the physiological performance of reef-building corals. Here, we used quantitative metabarcoding to investigate Symbiodinium genetic diversity in two species of mountainous star corals, Orbicella franksi and Orbicella faveolata, from two reefs separated by 19 km of deep water. We aimed to determine if the frequency of different symbiont genotypes varied with respect to coral host species or geographic location. Our results demonstrate that across the two reefs both coral species contained seven haplotypes of Symbiodinium, all identifiable as clade B and most closely related to type B1. Five of these haplotypes have not been previously described and may be endemic to the Flower Garden Banks. No significant differences in symbiont composition were detected between the two coral species. However, significant quantitative differences were detected between the east and west banks for three background haplotypes comprising 0.1%-10% of the total. The quantitative metabarcoding approach described here can help to sensitively characterize cryptic genetic diversity of Symbiodinium and potentially contribute to the understanding of physiological variations among coral populations.},

abstract = {Dark coloration of coral skeleton forming black bands is commonly observed in fractured, massive-coral colonies (Porites lutea and P. lobata) collected from Mayotte Island in the Mozambique Channel and Moorea Island in French Polynesia. Black-banding was similar in corals from the two areas and was associated with an assemblage of microbial endoliths: Ostreobium queketti, a common siphonal chlorophyte, and a type of Aspergillus-like fungus. Fungi of coral skeletons are capable of euendolithic growth entirely within the skeleton, and of cryptoendolithic growth whereby they spread from the skeleton into the skeletal pores. The morphology and size of fungal hyphae differs significantly between euendolithic, cryptoendolithic and reproductive phases. Reproductive phases involve formation of conidiophores. Insoluble residues in black bands involve a dark pigment and a dark membranous veil. When attacked by fungi, the algae are usually destroyed. They darken and are threaded by dense, dark-brown, fibrous excrescences. The fungi excrete a dark pigment that stains the surrounding skeletal carbonate black. The pigment is organic, and its presence correlates with higher concentrations of polysaccharides. Black bands match high-density bands of the coral skeleton. Both black bands and high-density bands form at the end of the rainy season in Mayotte. Thus, black-banding in the corals studied is caused by a series of events, beginning with an increase in the abundance of endolithic algae followed by an increase in skeletal density. The algae are then attacked by fungi, which produce more cryptoendolithic hyphae and conidia that are associated with production of the dark pigment.},

abstract = {The cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis is arguably one of the most important within the marine environment in that it is integral to the formation of coral reefs. However, the regulatory processes that perpetuate this symbiosis remain unresolved. It is essential to understand these processes, if we are to elucidate the mechanisms that support growth and resource accumulation by coral host, and conversely, recently observed reduction and/or mortality of corals in response to rapid environmental change. This study specifically focused on one area of metabolic activity within the symbiosis, that of free fatty acid synthesis within both the dinoflagellate symbionts and cnidarian host. The main model system used was Aiptasia pulchella and Symbiodinium sp. in combination with aposymbiotic A. pulchella, the symbiotic coral Acropora millepora system and dinoflagellate culture. Fatty acids (FAs) were selected because of their multiple essential roles inclusive of energy storage (resource accumulation), membrane structure fluidity and cell signaling. The study addressed free FA lipogenesis by using a new method of enriched stable isotopic ((13)C) incorporation from dissolved inorganic carbon (DI(13)C) combined with HPLC-MS. FAs derived from DI(13)C aligned with a mixture of known lipogenesis pathways with the addition of some unusual FAs. After 120 hr, (13)C-enriched FA synthesis rates were attributed to only a complex integration of both n-3 and n-6 lipogenesis pathways within the dinoflagellate symbionts. Furthermore, there was no detectible evidence of symbiont derived enriched isotope fatty acids, catabolized (13)C derivatives or DI(13)C being directly utilized, in host late n-6 pathway long-chain FA lipogenesis. These findings do not align with a popular mutualistic translocation model with respect to the use of translocated symbiont photoassimilates in host long-chain FA lipogenesis, which has important connotations for linking nutrient sources with metabolite production and the dynamic regulation of this symbiosis.},

abstract = {Animals must manage interactions with beneficial as well as detrimental microbes. Immunity therefore includes strategies for both resistance to and tolerance of microbial invaders. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF$\beta$) cytokines have many functions in animals including a tolerance-promoting (tolerogenic) role in immunity in vertebrates. TGF$\beta$ pathways are present in basal metazoans such as cnidarians but their potential role in immunity has never been explored. This study takes a two-part approach to examining an immune function for TGF$\beta$ in cnidarians. First bioinformatic analyses of the model anemone Aiptasia pallida were used to identify TGF$\beta$ pathway components and explore the hypothesis that an immune function for TGF$\beta$s existed prior to the evolution of vertebrates. A TGF$\beta$ ligand from A. pallida was identified as one that groups closely with vertebrate TGF$\beta$s that have an immune function. Second, cellular analyses of A. pallida were used to examine a role for a TGF$\beta$ pathway in the regulation of cnidarian-dinoflagellate mutualisms. These interactions are stable under ambient conditions but collapse under elevated temperature, a phenomenon called cnidarian bleaching. Addition of exogenous human TGF$\beta$ suppressed an immune response measured as LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production by the host. Addition of anti-TGF$\beta$ to block a putative TGF$\beta$ pathway resulted in immune stimulation and a failure of the symbionts to successfully colonize the host. Finally, addition of exogenous TGF$\beta$ suppressed immune stimulation in heat-stressed animals and partially abolished a bleaching response. These findings suggest that the dinoflagellate symbionts somehow promote host tolerance through activation of tolerogenic host immune pathways, a strategy employed by some intracellular protozoan parasites during their invasion of vertebrates. Insight into the ancient, conserved nature of host-microbe interactions gained from this cnidarian-dinoflagellate model is valuable to understanding the evolution of immunity and its role in the regulation of both beneficial and detrimental associations.},

Cryptosporidium parvum, Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma cruzi, Theileria spp., Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium spp. have all been shown to inhibit the apoptotic response of their host cell. While the pathogen mediators responsible for this modulation are unknown, the parasites are interacting with multiple apoptotic regulatory systems to render their host cell refractory to apoptosis during critical phases of intracellular infection, including parasite invasion, establishment and replication. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that the parasite life cycle stage impacts the modulation of apoptosis and possibly parasite differentiation. Dissection of the host-pathogen interactions involved in modulating apoptosis reveals a dynamic and complex interaction that recent studies are beginning to unravel.},

Here, we develop general theory for the density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism based on the C-R mechanism of interspecific interaction. To test the influence of C-R interactions on the dynamics and stability of bi- and uni-directional C-R mutualisms, we developed simple models that link consumer functional response of one mutualistic species with the resources supplied by another. Phase-plane analyses show that the ecological dynamics of C-R mutualisms are stable in general. Most transient behavior leads to an equilibrium of mutualistic coexistence, at which both species densities are greater than in the absence of interactions. However, due to the basic nature of C-R interactions, certain density-dependent conditions can lead to C-R dynamics characteristic of predator-prey interactions, in which one species overexploits and causes the other to go extinct. Consistent with empirical phenomena, these results suggest that the C-R interaction can provide a broad mechanism for understanding density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism. By unifying predation, competition, and mutualism under the common ecological framework of consumer-resource theory, we may also gain a better understanding of the universal features of interspecific interactions in general.},

abstract = {The precipitation and assembly of calcium carbonate skeletons by stony corals is a precisely controlled process regulated by the secretion of an ECM. Recently, it has been reported that the proteome of the skeletal organic matrix (SOM) contains a group of coral acid-rich proteins as well as an assemblage of adhesion and structural proteins, which together, create a framework for the precipitation of aragonite. To date, we are aware of no report that has investigated the localization of individual SOM proteins in the skeleton. In particular, no data are available on the ultrastructural mapping of these proteins in the calcification site or the skeleton. This information is crucial to assessing the role of these proteins in biomineralization. Immunological techniques represent a valuable approach to localize a single component within a calcified skeleton. By using immunogold labeling and immunohistochemical assays, here we show the spatial arrangement of key matrix proteins in tissue and skeleton of the common zooxanthellate coral, Stylophora pistillata. To our knowledge, our results reveal for the first time that, at the nanoscale, skeletal proteins are embedded within the aragonite crystals in a highly ordered arrangement consistent with a diel calcification pattern. In the tissue, these proteins are not restricted to the calcifying epithelium, suggesting that they also play other roles in the coral's metabolic pathways.},

The coral symbiosis is particularly susceptible to small increases of temperature above the long term summer maxima, which leads to the phenomenon known as coral bleaching, where the intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts are expelled. Here we for the first time used quantitative PCR to simultaneously examine the gene expression response of orthologs of the coral Acropora aspera and their dinoflagellate symbiont Symbiodinium . During an experimental bleaching event significant up-regulation of genes involved in stress response (HSP90 and HSP70) and carbon metabolism (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase) from the coral host were observed. In contrast in the symbiont, HSP90 expression decreased, while HSP70 levels were increased on only one day, and only the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase expression levels were found to increase. In addition the changes seen in expression patterns of the coral host were much larger, up to 10.5 fold, compared to the symbiont response, which in all cases was less than 2-fold. This targeted study of the expression of key metabolic and stress genes demonstrates that the response of the coral and their symbiont vary significantly, also a response in the host transcriptome was observed prior to what has previously been thought to be the temperatures at which thermal stress events occur.},

abstract = {Sessile animals, like corals, frequently suffer physical injury from a variety of sources, thus wound-healing mechanisms that restore tissue integrity and prevent infection are vitally important for defence. Despite the ecological importance of reef-building corals, little is known about the cells and processes involved in wound healing in this group or in phylogenetically basal metazoans in general. A histological investigation into wound healing of the scleractinian coral Porites cylindrica at 0 h, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h after injury revealed differences in cellular components between injured and healthy tissues. Cell counts of the obligate endosymbiont, Symbiodinium, and melanin volume fraction analysis revealed rapid declines in both Symbiodinium abundance and tissue cross-sectional area occupied by melanin-containing granular cells after injury. Four phases of wound healing were identified, which are similar to phases described for both vertebrates and invertebrates. The four phases included (i) plug formation via the degranulation of melanin-containing granular cells; (ii) immune cell infiltration (inflammation); (iii) granular tissue formation (proliferation); and (iv) maturation. This study provides detailed documentation of the processes involved in scleractinian wound healing for the first time and further elucidates the roles of previously-described immune cells, such as fibroblasts. These results demonstrate the conservation of wound healing processes from anthozoans to humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Coral reefs are facing increasing pressure from natural and anthropogenic stressors that have already caused significant worldwide declines. In January 2010, coral reefs of Florida, United States, were impacted by an extreme cold-water anomaly that exposed corals to temperatures well below their reported thresholds (16{\textdegree}C), causing rapid coral mortality unprecedented in spatial extent and severity.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Reef surveys were conducted from Martin County to the Lower Florida Keys within weeks of the anomaly. The impacts recorded were catastrophic and exceeded those of any previous disturbances in the region. Coral mortality patterns were directly correlated to in-situ and satellite-derived cold-temperature metrics. These impacts rival, in spatial extent and intensity, the impacts of the well-publicized warm-water bleaching events around the globe. The mean percent coral mortality recorded for all species and subregions was 11.5% in the 2010 winter, compared to 0.5% recorded in the previous five summers, including years like 2005 where warm-water bleaching was prevalent. Highest mean mortality (15%-39%) was documented for inshore habitats where temperatures were <11{\textdegree}C for prolonged periods. Increases in mortality from previous years were significant for 21 of 25 coral species, and were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher for most species.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:The cold-water anomaly of January 2010 caused the worst coral mortality on record for the Florida Reef Tract, highlighting the potential catastrophic impacts that unusual but extreme climatic events can have on the persistence of coral reefs. Moreover, habitats and species most severely affected were those found in high-coral cover, inshore, shallow reef habitats previously considered the "oases" of the region, having escaped declining patterns observed for more offshore habitats. Thus, the 2010 cold-water anomaly not only caused widespread coral mortality but also reversed prior resistance and resilience patterns that will take decades to recover.},

abstract = {A detailed understanding of the genetic structure of populations and an accurate interpretation of processes driving contemporary patterns of gene flow are fundamental to successful spatial conservation management. The field of seascape genetics seeks to incorporate environmental variables and processes into analyses of population genetic data to improve our understanding of forces driving genetic divergence in the marine environment. Information about barriers to gene flow (such as ocean currents) is used to define a resistance surface to predict the spatial genetic structure of populations and explain deviations from the widely applied isolation-by-distance model. The majority of seascape approaches to date have been applied to linear coastal systems or at large spatial scales (more than 250 km), with very few applied to complex systems at regional spatial scales (less than 100 km). Here, we apply a seascape genetics approach to a peripheral population of the broadcast-spawning coral Acropora spicifera across the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, a high-latitude complex coral reef system off the central coast of Western Australia. We coupled population genetic data from a panel of microsatellite DNA markers with a biophysical dispersal model to test whether oceanographic processes could explain patterns of genetic divergence. We identified significant variation in allele frequencies over distances of less than 10 km, with significant differentiation occurring between adjacent sites but not between the most geographically distant ones. Recruitment probabilities between sites based on simulated larval dispersal were projected into a measure of resistance to connectivity that was significantly correlated with patterns of genetic divergence, demonstrating that patterns of spatial genetic structure are a function of restrictions to gene flow imposed by oceanographic currents. This study advances our understanding of the role of larval dispersal on the fine-scale genetic structure of coral populations across a complex island system and applies a methodological framework that can be tailored to suit a variety of marine organisms with a range of life-history characteristics.},

abstract = {We spend the majority of our lives indoors where we are constantly exposed to bacteria residing on surfaces. However, the diversity of these surface-associated communities is largely unknown. We explored the biogeographical patterns exhibited by bacteria across ten surfaces within each of twelve public restrooms. Using high-throughput barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, we identified 19 bacterial phyla across all surfaces. Most sequences belonged to four phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The communities clustered into three general categories: those found on surfaces associated with toilets, those on the restroom floor, and those found on surfaces routinely touched with hands. On toilet surfaces, gut-associated taxa were more prevalent, suggesting fecal contamination of these surfaces. Floor surfaces were the most diverse of all communities and contained several taxa commonly found in soils. Skin-associated bacteria, especially the Propionibacteriaceae, dominated surfaces routinely touched with our hands. Certain taxa were more common in female than in male restrooms as vagina-associated Lactobacillaceae were widely distributed in female restrooms, likely from urine contamination. Use of the SourceTracker algorithm confirmed many of our taxonomic observations as human skin was the primary source of bacteria on restroom surfaces. Overall, these results demonstrate that restroom surfaces host relatively diverse microbial communities dominated by human-associated bacteria with clear linkages between communities on or in different body sites and those communities found on restroom surfaces. More generally, this work is relevant to the public health field as we show that human-associated microbes are commonly found on restroom surfaces suggesting that bacterial pathogens could readily be transmitted between individuals by the touching of surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can use high-throughput analyses of bacterial communities to determine sources of bacteria on indoor surfaces, an approach which could be used to track pathogen transmission and test the efficacy of hygiene practices.},

abstract = {Most reef-building corals in the order Scleractinia depend on endosymbiotic algae in the genus Symbiodinium for energy and survival. Significant levels of taxonomic diversity in both partners result in numerous possible combinations of coral-Symbiodinium associations with unique functional characteristics. We created and analyzed the first coral-Symbiodinium networks utilizing a global dataset of interaction records from coral reefs in the tropical Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans for 1991 to 2010. Our meta-analysis reveals that the majority of coral species and Symbiodinium types are specialists, but failed to detect any one-to-one obligate relationships. Symbiont specificity is correlated with a host's transmission mode, with horizontally transmitting corals being more likely to interact with generalist symbionts. Globally, Symbiodinium types tend to interact with only vertically or horizontally transmitting corals, and only a few generalist types are found with both. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between symbiont specificity, symbiont transmission mode, and community partitioning. The structure and dynamics of these network interactions underlie the fundamental biological partnership that determines the condition and resilience of coral reef ecosystems.},

abstract = {High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a closed-tube, rapid and sensitive technique able to detect DNA variations. It relies on the fluorescence melting curves that are obtained from the transition of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a result of temperature increase. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of HRM as a tool to rapidly and precisely genotype monotypic Symbiodinium populations using the internal transcribed spacer, region 2, ribosomal DNA (ITS2 rDNA). For this, Symbiodinium denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles, where gel bands were excised and sequenced, were compared to HRM genotypes. Results showed that twenty cultures were correctly genotyped in <2 h using HRM analysis with a percentage of confidence >90%. Limitations of the technique were also investigated. Unlike other techniques used for genotyping Symbiodinium, such as DGGE and other fingerprint profiles, HRM is a technique of great advantage for field coral reef ecologists and physiologists as no expertise in advanced molecular methods is required.},

abstract = {The phytoplankton assemblage in Lake Kinneret is dominated in spring by a bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense, which terminates sharply in summer [1]. The pH in Peridinium patches rises during the bloom to values higher than pH9 [2] and results in CO2 limitation. Here we show that depletion of dissolved CO2 (CO2(dis)) stimulated formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced cell death in both natural and cultured Peridinium populations. In contrast, addition of CO2 prevented ROS formation. Catalase inhibited cell death in culture, implicating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the active ROS. Cell death was also blocked by a cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64, a treatment which stimulated cyst formation. Intracellular ROS accumulation induced protoplast shrinkage and DNA fragmentation prior to cell death. We propose that CO2 limitation resulted in the generation of ROS to a level that induced programmed cell death, which resembles apoptosis in animal and plant cells. Our results also indicate that cysteine protease(s) are involved in processes that determine whether a cell is destined to die or to form a cyst.},

This oceanographic instrument, used to measure the in vivo phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence, was adapted to record the natural fluorescence of C. caespitosa by SCUBA divers. The resulting curves of natural fluorescence of Chl a vs photosynthetically active radiation (PAR 400-700 nm) showed that: (1) natural fluorescence was limited by light availability in both deep and shallow colonies in all seasons; (2) photosynthesis occurred in C. caespitosa also in winter, when temperature is low and seawater turbidity contributes significantly to PAR attenuation; and (3) the efficiency of the Chl a fluorescence increased from summer to winter. This last finding outlines the winter coupling between zooxanthellae activity and calcification processes and is consistent with the formation of the high density band in the coral skeleton.},

abstract = {Key insight into the complexities of apoptosis may be gained from the study of its evolution in lower metazoans. In this study we describe two genes from a cnidarian, Aiptasia pallida, that are homologous to key genes in the apoptotic pathway from vertebrates. The first is a novel ancient caspase, acasp, that displays attributes of both initiator and executioner caspases and includes a caspase recruitment domain (CARD). The second, a Bcl-2 family member, abhp, contains a BH1 and BH2 domain and shares structural characteristics and phylogenetic affinity with a group of antiapoptotic Bcl-2s including A1 and Bcl-2L10. The breadth of occurrence of other invertebrate homologues across the phylogenetic trees of both genes suggests that the complexity of apoptotic pathways is an ancient trait that predates the evolution of vertebrates and higher invertebrates such as nematodes and flies. This paves the way for establishing new lower metazoan model systems for the study of apoptosis.},

We investigated the combined influences of spatial isolation and disturbance on the population dynamics of the generalist Symbiodinium type C2 (ITS1 rDNA) hosted by the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora in the central Great Barrier Reef. Using eight microsatellite markers, we genotyped Symbiodinium in a total of 401 coral colonies, which were sampled from seven sites across a 12-year period including during flood plume-induced coral bleaching. Genetic differentiation of Symbiodinium was greatest within sites, explaining 70-86% of the total genetic variation. An additional 9-27% of variation was explained by significant differentiation of populations among sites separated by 0.4-13~km, which is consistent with low levels of dispersal via water movement and historical disturbance regimes. Sampling year accounted for 6-7% of total genetic variation and was related to significant coral mortality following severe bleaching in 1998 and a cyclone in 2006. Only 3% of the total genetic variation was related to coral bleaching status, reflecting generally small (8%) reductions in allelic diversity within bleached corals. This reduction probably reflected a loss of genotypes in hospite during bleaching, although no site-wide changes in genetic diversity were observed. Combined, our results indicate the importance of disturbance regimes acting together with limited oceanographic transport to determine the genetic composition of Symbiodinium types within reefs.},

abstract = {Symbiotic associations between invertebrates and dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium are a common occurrence in marine environments. However, despite our extensive knowledge concerning the physiological contributions of these algae to their symbiotic partners, our understanding of zooxanthella phylogenetics is still in its early stages. In the past 10 years, studies of Symbiodinium phylogenetics have relied solely on nuclear ribosomal (rDNA) genes. To date, organellar DNA sequences have not been employed to infer phylogenies for this genus of symbiotic dinoflagellates. We address this by presenting the first Symbiodinium phylogeny based on chloroplast (cp) large subunit (23S)-rDNA sequences. Cp23S-rDNA Domain V sequences were determined for 35 dinoflagellate cultures isolated from a range of invertebrate host species and geographical locations. Symbiodinium phylogenies inferred from cp23S-rDNA produced topologies that were not statistically different from those generated from nuclear rDNA, providing the first independent evidence supporting the published major clades of Symbiodinium. In addition, comparisons of sequence dissimilarity indicated that cp23S-rDNA Domain V evolves 9-30 times faster than the V1-V4 regions of nuclear small subunit (n18S)-rDNA, 1-7 times as fast as the D1-D3 regions of nuclear large subunit (n28S)-rDNA, and 0.27-2.25 times that of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-rDNA region. Our data suggested that cp23S-rDNA Domain V will prove to be a useful molecule for exploring Symbiodinium phylogenetics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bar-coded pyrosequencing has been increasingly used due to its fine taxonomic resolution and high throughput. Yet, concerns arise regarding the reproducibility of bar-coded pyrosequencing. We evaluated the run-to-run variation of bar-coded pyrosequencing in detecting bacterial community shifts and taxa dynamics. Our results demonstrate that pyrosequencing is reproducible in evaluating community shifts within a run, but not between runs. Also, the reproducibility of pyrosequencing in detecting individual taxa increased as a function of taxa abundance. Based on our findings: (1) for studies with modest sequencing depth, it is doubtful that data from different pyrosequencing runs can be considered comparable; (2) if multiple pyrosequencing runs are needed to increase the sequencing depth, additional sequencing efforts should be applied to all samples, rather than to selected samples; (3) if pyrosequencing is used for estimating bacterial population dynamics, only the abundant taxa should be considered; (4) for less-abundant taxa, the sequencing depth should be increased to ensure an accurate evaluation of taxon variation trends across samples.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:The human microbiome plays an important role in human disease and health. Identification of factors that affect the microbiome composition can provide insights into disease mechanism as well as suggest ways to modulate the microbiome composition for therapeutical purposes. Distance-based statistical tests have been applied to test the association of microbiome composition with environmental or biological covariates. The unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances are the most widely used distance measures. However, these two measures assign too much weight either to rare lineages or to most abundant lineages, which can lead to loss of power when the important composition change occurs in moderately abundant lineages.

RESULTS:We develop generalized UniFrac distances that extend the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances for detecting a much wider range of biologically relevant changes. We evaluate the use of generalized UniFrac distances in associating microbiome composition with environmental covariates using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that tests using the unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances are less powerful in detecting abundance change in moderately abundant lineages. In contrast, the generalized UniFrac distance is most powerful in detecting such changes, yet it retains nearly all its power for detecting rare and highly abundant lineages. The generalized UniFrac distance also has an overall better power than the joint use of unweighted/weighted UniFrac distances. Application to two real microbiome datasets has demonstrated gains in power in testing the associations between human microbiome and diet intakes and habitual smoking.

Scleractinia were active sediment shedders, alcyonacea passive, relying on water motion and gravity. Short-term sand clearing efficiency was primarily dependent on corallum shape. Sand application led to hydrostatic inflation of polyps in scleractinia and the entire colony in alcyonacea as well as to increased tentacular action in the scleractinian Gyrosmilia interrupta. Under continuous sand application, inflation remained while other activities, such as tentacular motion, ceased completely. In scleractinia and alcyonacea, tissue necroses appeared after the first week of continuous sand application. Death of entire colonies and partial bleaching of continually sand-covered areas were observed in alcyonacea only. Different grain sizes of sand had no influence on clearing reaction or efficiencies.},

abstract = {Scleractinian corals have adapted to live in habitats were the level of ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm) is extremely high. The putative photoprotective molecules called mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) contained in the corals' tissues absorb UVR and release it harmlessly as heat. MAA concentration in corals is quite plastic and cot-relates well with UVR dose, but other ecological factors such as water motion may influence MAA production as well. In this study, the effects of ambient UVR and water motion on MAA concentration and several physiological parameters of the reef coral Porites compressa Dana were investigated in a two by two factorial transplantation experiment. Replicate branches from nine morphologically distinct colonies were transplanted from the windward side of Coconut Island (Kaneohe Bay, HI) to a control area on the windward side (ambient water motion) and to an area on the leeward side (low water motion). The transplanted corals were placed under UV-opaque (UVO) or UV-transparent (UVT) filters fixed to the reef. Initially and at 3 and 6 weeks, coral branches were weighed to determine calcification rate and tissues were extracted in methanol for photosynthetic pigment and MAA analysis via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). UVR was a significant factor determining MAA concentration, When UVR was screened from the corals' environment, total MAA concentration decreased by 33% over 6 weeks. However, UVR-exposed corals moved to low water motion also decreased MAA levels, while UVR-exposed corals moved to the control area retained initial levels. Photosynthetic pigments and calcification rate were also significantly reduced in corals moved to low water motion. There was no UVR effect on photosynthetic pigments or calcification rate. This study provides evidence that water motion is important for the maintenance of MAAs. However, there were interesting colony-specific patterns in MAA composition and response to the UVR treatments some colonies had high total concentrations of MAAs in all treatments, while others displayed a pronounced UVR effect. Also, each genotype seemed to have its own signature MAA composition. These findings indicate a genetic (host, zooxanthellae or both) component to UVR resistance in this population of P. compressa.

abstract = {The global distribution of marine species, many of which disperse during the larval stages, is influenced by ocean temperature regimes. Here, we test how temperature and the coral symbionts ( Symbiodinium ) affect survival, symbiont uptake, settlement success and habitat choice of Acropora millepora larvae. Experiments were conducted at Heron Island (Australia), where larvae were exposed to 22.5, 24.5, 26.5 and 28.5{\textdegree}C. Within each temperature treatment, larvae were offered symbionts with distinct characteristics: (i) homologous Symbiodinium type C3, (ii) regionally homologous thermo-tolerant type D1, and (iii) heterologous thermo-tolerant type C15, as well as controls of (iv) un-filtered and (v) filtered seawater. Results show that lower instead of higher temperatures adversely affected recruitment by reducing larval survival and settlement. Low temperatures also reduced recruit habitat choice and initial symbiont densities, both of which impact on post-settlement survival. At lower temperatures, larvae increasingly settle away from preferred vertical surfaces and not on crustose coralline algae (CCA). Surprisingly, substrate preference to CCA was modified by the presence of specific symbiont genotypes that were present ex-hospite (outside the coral larvae). When different symbionts were mixed, the outcomes were non-additive, indicating that symbiont interactions modify the response. We propose that the observed influence of ex-hospite symbionts on settlement behaviour may have evolved through ecological facilitation and the study highlights the importance of biological processes during coral settlement.},

abstract = {Staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) and elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), are important reef builders in the Caribbean. In the early to middle Holocene (10000-6000 years ago), when sea temperatures were warmer than today, Acropora-dominated reefs were common along the east coast of Florida as far north as Palm Beach County. The fossil record shows that the northern limits of these two cold-sensitive species subsequently contracted to Biscayne Bay, south of Miami, apparently as a result of climatic cooling. This response of the Acropora species to climate provides a context for interpreting recent shifts in their geographic distribution. Despite recent disease-induced mass mortalities throughout the Caribbean and western Atlantic, the two species are now re-expanding their ranges northward along the Florida Peninsula and into the northern Gulf of Mexico, coincident with increasing sea temperatures. In the face of continued global warming, the northernmost limit of this range expansion will ultimately be determined by a combination of temperature and other physical constraints.},

abstract = {Much of the current knowledge concerning bivalve immunology and immunotoxicology has come from studies on the mussel genus, Mytilus, or from the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Following a major oil spill, it was observed that the marine mussel, Mytilus edulis, underwent significant immunosuppression but no oil-induced mortalities, while in contrast, mass mortalities were noted in the edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule, and the razor-shell, Ensis siliqua. A study comparing immune cells and functions in these three species was initiated (i) to assess whether M. edulis was a representative model species and (ii) to provide baseline data on immunity in two common species, which had previously received little or no attention in this respect. While all three species shared similar cell types, their lectin-binding and enzyme cytochemistry differed considerably. M. edulis had significantly different proportions of haemocytes binding with the lectins concanavalin A, wheatgerm agglutinin and Helix pomatia agglutinin and stained positive for eight enzymes, compared with only five in C. edule and three in E. siliqua. In terms of immune function, M. edulis haemocytes were much more active in phagocytosis and superoxide generation than haemocytes of the other two species. The results show that immune cells and functions differed extensively in these three closely related species, with M. edulis showing a much higher level of immunological vigour that may be linked to its considerable resilience to adverse environmental conditions. This suggests that M edulis may not be particularly representative of the bivalves in terms of immune reactivity and that a wider range of species should be included in studies of molluscan immunotoxicology.

abstract = {The effects of asexual, leaf-inhabiting endophytes on the growth of Lolium perenne are notoriously inconsistent and appear to be contingent on environmental conditions and host genetics. Both positive and negative growth effects of endophytes have been documented in some forage crop cultivars. Because they utilize host photosynthates, it is hypothesized that endophytes would impart a growth cost to infected plants under extreme resource limitation. The potential costs of infection by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii to its host grass, L. perenne, were investigated in accessions from Italy, Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia, the native part of the host's range. Four to five infected (+E) genotypes of L. perenne per accession were cloned into ramets, and the endophyte exterminated from half of the ramets (-E). Six +E and six -E ramets per genotype were grown for 5 months in a nutrient-poor substrate (vermiculite) within temperature- and light-controlled growth chambers. Accession and genotype within accession affected dry mass. Endophyte infection significantly reduced root:shoot ratio and the proportion of the shoot that was alive and photosynthetic. Relative interaction intensity indexes were negative for most genotypes, indicating host-endophyte associations were mostly parasitic. However, there were significant infection by genotype interactions; thus, endophyte-mediated effects depend on particular host genotype-endophyte combinations. This research is one of the few that have documented costs to endophyte infection in a grass-endophyte symbiosis. This cost, manifested as reduced root:shoot ratio and photosynthetic shoot fraction, was evident for infected L. perenne growing under conditions of extremely poor substrate nutrient availability.

abstract = {Anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 over this century are predicted to cause global average surface ocean pH to decline by 0.1-0.3 pH units and sea surface temperature to increase by 1-4{\textdegree}C. We conducted controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the impacts of CO2-induced ocean acidification (pCO2 = 324, 477, 604, 2553 {\textmu}atm) and warming (25, 28, 32{\textdegree}C) on the calcification rate of the zooxanthellate scleractinian coral Siderastrea siderea, a widespread, abundant and keystone reef-builder in the Caribbean Sea. We show that both acidification and warming cause a parabolic response in the calcification rate within this coral species. Moderate increases in pCO2 and warming, relative to near-present-day values, enhanced coral calcification, with calcification rates declining under the highest pCO2 and thermal conditions. Equivalent responses to acidification and warming were exhibited by colonies across reef zones and the parabolic nature of the corals' response to these stressors was evident across all three of the experiment's 30-day observational intervals. Furthermore, the warming projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the end of the twenty-first century caused a fivefold decrease in the rate of coral calcification, while the acidification projected for the same interval had no statistically significant impact on the calcification rate-suggesting that ocean warming poses a more immediate threat than acidification for this important coral species.},

abstract = {The persistence of coral reef ecosystems relies on the symbiotic relationship between scleractinian corals and intracellular, photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Genetic evidence indicates that these symbionts are biologically diverse and exhibit discrete patterns of environmental and host distribution. This makes the assessment of Symbiodinium diversity critical to understanding the symbiosis ecology of corals. Here, we applied pyrosequencing to the elucidation of Symbiodinium diversity via analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region, a multicopy genetic marker commonly used to analyse Symbiodinium diversity. Replicated data generated from isoclonal Symbiodinium cultures showed that all genomes contained numerous, yet mostly rare, ITS2 sequence variants. Pyrosequencing data were consistent with more traditional denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) approaches to the screening of ITS2 PCR amplifications, where the most common sequences appeared as the most intense bands. Further, we developed an operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-based pipeline for Symbiodinium ITS2 diversity typing to provisionally resolve ecologically discrete entities from intragenomic variation. A genetic distance cut-off of 0.03 collapsed intragenomic ITS2 variants of isoclonal cultures into single OTUs. When applied to the analysis of field-collected coral samples, our analyses confirm that much of the commonly observed Symbiodinium ITS2 diversity can be attributed to intragenomic variation. We conclude that by analysing Symbiodinium populations in an OTU-based framework, we can improve objectivity, comparability and simplicity when assessing ITS2 diversity in field-based studies.},

abstract = {Zooxanthellae in different stages of two opposite processes, degradation and proliferation, were found in the planulae of hermatypic corals. The formation of new zooxanthellae is balanced by degraded zooxanthellae in newly released planulae. The number of dividing zooxanthellae and degraded zooxanthellae during the day amounted to approximately 2 to 3% of the standing stock. In settled planulae and particularly in motionless planulae of Stylophora pistillata (Esper, 1797), the degraded zooxanthellae outnumbered proliferous zooxanthellae. The proliferation and degradation of zooxanthellae and the extrusion of degraded remnants of zooxanthellae are significantly phased. Swimming planulae are more autotrophic than motionless planulae. The physiological parameters of settled planulae with exoskeleton are similar to those of adult polyps. The significance of zooxanthella degradation in the vital functions of planulae is discussed. We suggest that the degradation of zooxanthellae in planulae occurs by the digestion of symbionts by host cells.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new ordination method to compare several communities containing species that differ according to their taxonomic, morphological or biological features. The objective is first to find dissimilarities among communities from the knowledge about differences among their species, and second to describe these dissimilarities with regard to the feature diversity within communities. In 1986, Rao initiated a general framework for analysing the extent of the diversity. He defined a diversity coefficient called quadratic entropy and a dissimilarity coefficient and proposed a decomposition of this diversity coefficient in a way similar to ANOVA. Furthermore, Gower and Legendre (1986) built a weighted principal coordinate analysis. Using the previous context, we propose a new method called the double principal coordinate analysis (DPCoA) to analyse the relation between two kinds of data. The first contains differences among species (dissimilarity matrix); the second the species distribution among communities (abundance or presence/absence matrix). A multidimensional space assembling the species points and the community points is built. The species points define the original differences between species and the community points define the deduced differences between communities. Furthermore, this multidimensional space is linked with the diversity decomposition into between-community and within-community diversities. One looks for axes that provide a graphical ordination of the communities and project the species onto them. An illustration is proposed comparing bird communities which live in different areas under mediterranean bioclimates. Compared to some existing methods, the double principal coordinate analysis can provide a typology of communities taking account of an abundance matrix and can include dissimilarities among species. Finally, we show that such an approach generalizes some of these methods and allows us to develop new analyses.},

Continuous in situ water temperature recordings since 1991 suggest a close correlation between bleaching of corals and periods of average daily seawater temperatures approaching 32 degrees C. Each of the bleaching events has occurred during periods of unusually high air temperatures, suggesting that 'heat waves' cause a warming of the inshore waters and are a contributory factor in the recurrent bleaching of corals at Magnetic Island. There has been a significant increase in annual summer and winter air temperatures in the Magnetic Island area since the middle of the present century. Significant warming trends have also been observed in the nearby state of Queensland and in Eastern Australia over the same period. Air temperatures similar to those present during the 5 bleaching events which occurred at Magnetic Island have not otherwise been experienced in this area since the 1930s.},

abstract = {Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a systematic, though abstract, way to describe how an organism acquires and uses energy and essential elements for physiological processes, in addition to how physiological performance is influenced by environmental variables such as food density and temperature. A 'standard' DEB model describes the performance (growth, development, reproduction, respiration, etc.) of all life stages of an animal (embryo to adult), and predicts both intraspecific and interspecific variation in physiological rates. This approach contrasts with a long tradition of more phenomenological and parameter-rich bioenergetic models that are used to make predictions from species-specific rate measurements. These less abstract models are widely used in fisheries studies; they are more readily interpretable than DEB models, but lack the generality of DEB models. We review the interconnections between the two approaches and present formulae relating the state variables and fluxes in the standard DEB model to measured bioenergetic rate processes. We illustrate this synthesis for two large fishes: Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) and Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). For each, we have a parameter-sparse, full-life-cycle DEB model that requires adding only a few species-specific features to the standard model. Both models allow powerful integration of knowledge derived from data restricted to certain life stages, processes and environments.},

abstract = {The dual character of corals, that they are both auto- and heterotrophs, was recognized early in the twentieth Century. It is generally accepted that the symbiotic association between corals and their endosymbiotic algae (called zooxanthellae) is fundamental to the development of coral reefs in oligotrophic tropical oceans because zooxanthellae transfer the major part of their photosynthates to the coral host (autotrophic nutrition). However, numerous studies have confirmed that many species of corals are also active heterotrophs, ingesting organisms ranging from bacteria to mesozooplankton. Heterotrophy accounts for between 0 and 66% of the fixed carbon incorporated into coral skeletons and can meet from 15 to 35% of daily metabolic requirements in healthy corals and up to 100% in bleached corals. Apart from this carbon input, feeding is likely to be important to most scleractinian corals, since nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients that cannot be supplied from photosynthesis by the coral's symbiotic algae must come from zooplankton capture, particulate matter or dissolved compounds. A recent study showed that during bleaching events some coral species, by increasing their feeding rates, are able to maintain and restore energy reserves. This review assesses the importance and effects of heterotrophy in tropical scleractinian corals. We first provide background information on the different food sources (from dissolved organic matter to meso- and macrozooplankton). We then consider the nutritional inputs of feeding. Finally, we review feeding effects on the different physiological parameters of corals (tissue composition, photosynthesis and skeletal growth).},

abstract = {The field of microalgal-invertebrate symbiosis has gradually been undergoing some significant conceptual changes. The concept of low genetic diversity among symbiotic microalgae and high diversity among animal hosts has been challenged, and shown to be inaccurate. An increasingly high taxonomic diversity of microalgae are now recognized as forming symbioses with a high diversity of invertebrates, in marine and freshwater habitats, in benthic and pelagic communities. Information from a wide range of sources indicates that there is symbiont-host specificity in these symbioses at the species level, a realization that is completely in agreement with the patterns observed in other mutualistic and in parasitic symbioses. There has been a general misunderstanding that the less restrictive specificity observed under laboratory conditions is equivalent to that occurring in the natural environment. The mechanism of selectivity underlying the expressed specificity of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses is unknown, but evidence supporting the concept of molecular signalling between symbionts and hosts is rapidly accumulating. Such molecular ''cross-talk'' between symbionts and hosts has now been documented in bacteria-legume symbioses, and has also been implicated in interactions between plants and bacterial pathogens. Many aspects of the physiology, biochemistry and ecology of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses are better appreciated with the realization that functional diversity probably parallels genetic (taxonomic) diversity, and many of the apparently controversial aspects of the biology of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses can be reconciled by embracing this idea. Based on recent new evidence on the structure and composition of the photosynthetic apparatus of symbiotic dinoflagellates, it is apparent that some of the paradigms of functional, and ultimately, ecological aspects of the symbioses involving these algae will have to be modified. Of the various subdisciplines of the field, the most controversial, and indeed confusing, is that pertaining to the acquisition and utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus.I have attempted to review the various aspects of microalgal-invertebrate symbioses pertaining to their taxonomy, genetic diversity and evolution, morphology, biochemistry and physiology, as concisely as possible. As I believe that the field lacks an overall general theory that would guide future research directions, I conclude the article with a speculative discourse which hopefully may serve as a focal point. I believe that most of the ideas expressed, though not always supported by tangible evidence, are cast in the form of potentially testable hypotheses.},

abstract = {Dispersal may be a critical factor in the ability of reef-building corals to recover after major disturbances. We studied patterns of geographical structure using four microsatellite markers in seven South Pacific populations of Pocillopora meandrina, a major coral species from Polynesia. Variation within populations showed evidence of heterozygote deficiency. Genetic differentiation between populations was detected at a large scale (2000 km) between the Tonga and the Society Islands. Within the Society Islands, four of the five studied populations from Bora Bora, Moorea and Tahiti were not significantly different from each other. Unexpectedly, one of the three populations surveyed in Moorea was genetically different from the other two populations of this island (that were 5 and 10 km apart), and from the populations of the other two surveyed islands in this archipelago. We cannot rule out the possibility that this pattern is an equilibrium state, whereby short-range dispersal is locally more differentiating than long-range dispersal, as has been suggested by similar patterns reported in other studies. An alternative explanation that is globally consistent with all observations is that this is the signature of a large-scale destruction event, as for instance a bleaching event, followed by the recent restoration of populations by new colonists.},

abstract = {Corals have been shown to bleach through the combined effects of elevated sea temperature and high solar radiation. In this study, cores from the west and east sides of a hemispherical shallow reef coral, Goniastrea aspera, were exposed to ambient and elevated water temperature treatments, combined with varying natural solar radiation regimes for periods of 3 d at different times of the year. At elevated temperature, the loss of zooxanthellae from east-side cores was directly related to the dose of solar radiation (measured as photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], 400 to 700 nm). Elevated temperature (+4 degrees C) was responsible for 35% of the total loss, and PAR dose for up to a further 14%. Zooxanthellae from cores from both the east and west sides exhibited chronic photoinhibition (a reduction in maximal photochemical yield [F-v/F-m]) in both the ambient and elevated temperature treatments, which was directly related to the PAR dose. The chronic photoinhibition was consistently greater in the elevated temperature treatment, and also in the east cores relative to the west. These results quantify the direct contribution of solar radiation to both chronic photoinhibition and loss of zooxanthellae. The differences in both loss of zooxanthellae and photoinhibition between the different faces of the coral colony can be directly attributed to differences in prior experience, whereby the west sides of the coral had been exposed to higher natural solar radiation throughout the year, thus conferring greater tolerance to the effects of elevated temperature and solar radiation.},

abstract = {Fourteen reef-building coral species of Anthozoa and Hydrozoa classes, collected in various regions of the Indo-Pacific, were analyzed for fatty acid composition by gas-liquid chromatography. Total lipids of the corals had the same set of fatty acids. The main fatty acids were 16:0, 18:0, 18:1(n-9), 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3), but some coral families had significant levels of characteristic fatty acids: Pocilloporidae - 20:3(n-6); Acroporidae - 18:3(n-6), 18:4(n-3) and 22:4(n-6); Poritidae - 18:3(n-6); Milleporidae - 22:4(n-6), 22:5(n-6) and 22:6(n-3). Related species of Pocilloporidae from Vietnam and Seychelles differed greatly in their content of saturated acids - 50 to 60% and 30%, respectively. As shown for Stylophora pistillata, the depth of the habitat affects the degree of fatty acid unsaturation and (n-3)/(n-6) ratio of neutral lipids, but does not affect phospholipid fatty acids. A possible role of DELTA-5- and DELTA-4- desaturases in determining fatty acid pool formation in reef-building corals is discussed with reference to their nutritional characteristics.},

abstract = {Caribbean corals of the Montastraea annularis species complex associate with four taxa of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae; genus Symbiodinium) in ecologically predictable patterns. To investigate the resilience of these host-zooxanthella associations, we conducted field experiments in which we experimentally reduced the numbers of zooxanthellae (by transplanting to shallow water or by shading) and then allowed treated corals to recover. When depletion was not extreme, recovering corals generally contained the same types of zooxanthellae as they did prior to treatment. After severe depletion, however, recovering corals were always repopulated by zooxanthellae atypical for their habitat (and in some cases atypical for the coral species). These unusual zooxanthellar associations were often (but not always) established in experimentally bleached tissues even when adjacent tissues were untreated. Atypical zooxanthellae were also observed in bleached tissues of unmanipulated Montastraea with yellow-blotch disease. In colonies where unusual associations were established, the original taxa of zooxanthellae were not detected even 9 months after the end of treatment. These observations suggest that zooxanthellae in Montastraea range from fugitive opportunists and stress-tolerant generalists (Symbiodinium A and E) to narrowly adapted specialists (Symbiodinium B and Q, and may undergo succession.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Corals represent symbiotic meta-organisms that require harmonization among the coral animal, photosynthetic zooxanthellae and associated microbes to survive environmental stresses. We investigated integrated-responses among coral and zooxanthellae in the scleractinian coral Acropora formosa in response to an emerging marine pollutant, the munitions constituent, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5 triazine (RDX; 5 day exposures to 0 (control), 0.5, 0.9, 1.8, 3.7, and 7.2 mg/L, measured in seawater).

RESULTS:RDX accumulated readily in coral soft tissues with bioconcentration factors ranging from 1.1 to 1.5). Next-generation sequencing of a normalized meta-transcriptomic library developed for the eukaryotic components of the A. formosa coral holobiont was leveraged to conduct microarray-based global transcript expression analysis of integrated coral / zooxanthellae responses to the RDX exposure. Total differentially expressed transcripts (DET) increased with increasing RDX exposure concentrations as did the proportion of zooxanthellae DET relative to the coral animal. Transcriptional responses in the coral demonstrated higher sensitivity to RDX compared to zooxanthellae where increased expression of gene transcripts coding xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms (i.e. cytochrome P450 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family) were initiated at the lowest exposure concentration. Increased expression of these detoxification mechanisms was sustained at higher RDX concentrations as well as production of a physical barrier to exposure through a 40% increase in mucocyte density at the maximum RDX exposure. At and above the 1.8 mg/L exposure concentration, DET coding for genes involved in central energy metabolism, including photosynthesis, glycolysis and electron-transport functions, were decreased in zooxanthellae although preliminary data indicated that zooxanthellae densities were not affected. In contrast, significantly increased transcript expression for genes involved in cellular energy production including glycolysis and electron-transport pathways was observed in the coral animal.

CONCLUSIONS:Transcriptional network analysis for central energy metabolism demonstrated highly correlated responses to RDX among the coral animal and zooxanthellae indicative of potential compensatory responses to lost photosynthetic potential within the holobiont. These observations underscore the potential for complex integrated responses to RDX exposure among species comprising the coral holobiont and highlight the need to understand holobiont-species interactions to accurately assess pollutant impacts.},

The efficiency with which prey nitrogen was incorporated into cnidarian tissues was species-specific. O. arbuscula with a full complement of zooxanthellae had an assimilation efficiency of nearly 100%, compared to only 46% for corals containing few zooxanthellae. In A. pallida, symbiont density had no effect, and nitrogen assimilation was 23 to 29%. In both species, the host retained the bulk of the ingested label. Complete digestion was rapid (< 4 h), as was the partitioning of the label between host amino acids and macromolecules. The label was primarily in the low-molecular weight-amino acid pool in O. arbuscula, where it remained for 30 h. A maximum of ca. 20% of the N-15 appeared in the zooxanthellae, where it was rapidly converted into macromolecules. Individual amino acids in A. pallida tissues were highly labeled with N-15 within 4 h and showed no subsequent enrichment with time; however, zooxanthellae amino acids became increasingly enriched over 30 h. Differences in N-15 enrichment among amino acids were consistent with known synthesis and transformation pathways, but it was not possible to discriminate between host feeding and de novo synthesis.},

abstract = {With coral cover in decline on many Caribbean reefs, any process of coral mortality is of potential concern. While sparisomid parrotfishes are major grazers of Caribbean reefs and help control algal blooms, the fact that they also undertake corallivory has prompted some to question the rationale for their conservation. Here the weight of evidence for beneficial effects of parrotfishes, in terms of reducing algal cover and facilitating demographic processes in corals, and the deleterious effects of parrotfishes in terms of causing coral mortality and chronic stress, are reviewed. While elevated parrotfish density will likely increase the predation rate upon juvenile corals, the net effect appears to be positive in enhancing coral recruitment through removal of macroalgal competitors. Parrotfish corallivory can cause modest partial colony mortality in the most intensively grazed species of Montastraea but the generation and healing of bite scars appear to be in near equilibrium, even when coral cover is low. Whole colony mortality in adult corals can lead to complete exclusion of some delicate, lagoonal species of Porites from forereef environments but is only reported for one reef species (Porites astreoides), for one habitat (backreef), and with uncertain incidence (though likely << 10%). No deleterious effects of predation on coral growth or fecundity have been reported, though recovery of zooxanthellae after bleaching events may be retarded. The balance of evidence to date finds strong support for the herbivory role of parrotfishes in facilitating coral recruitment, growth, and fecundity. In contrast, no net deleterious effects of corallivory have been reported for reef corals. Corallivory is unlikely to constrain overall coral cover but contraints upon dwindling populations of the Montastraea annularis species complex are feasible and the role of parrotfishes as a vector of coral disease requires evaluation. However, any assertion that conservation practices should guard against protecting corallivorous parrotfishes appears to be unwarranted at this stage.},

abstract = {Corals of the Montastraea annularis complex host several different dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Here we address two questions arising from our previous studies of these associations on an offshore reef. First, do the same taxa and patterns of association (Symbiodinium A and B found in higher irradiance habitats than Symbiodinium C) occur on an inshore reef? Second, does M. franksi at the limits of its, depth range host only Symbiodinium C, as it does at intermediate depths? In both surveys, a new Symbiodinium taxon and different patterns of distribution (assayed by analyses of small ribosomal subunit RNA genes [srDNA]) were observed. Inshore, a taxon we name Symbiodinium E predominated in higher irradiance habitats in M. franksi and its two sibling species; the only other zooxanthella observed was Symbiodinium C. Offshore, M. franksi mainly hosted Symbiodinium C, but hosted Symbiodinium A, B, C, and E in shallow water and Symbiodinium E and C in very deep water. Symbiodinium E may be stress-tolerant. Observed srDNA heterogeneity within samples of Symbiodinium B, C, and E is interpreted as variation across copies within this multigene family. Experimental bleaching of Symiodinium C supported this interpretation. Thus sequences from natural samples should be interpreted cautiously.},

abstract = {With recent methodological advances, molecular markers are increasingly used for semi-quantitative analyses of fungal communities. The aim to preserve quantitative relationships between genotypes through PCR places new demands on primers to accurately match target sites and provide short amplicons. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosome encoding genes is a commonly used marker for many fungal groups. Here, we describe three new primers - fITS7, gITS7 and fITS9, which may be used to amplify the fungal ITS2 region by targeting sites in the 5.8S encoding gene. We evaluated the primers and compared their performance with the commonly used ITS1f primer by 454-sequencing of both artificially assembled templates and field samples. When the entire ITS region was amplified using the ITS1f/ITS4 primer combination, we found strong bias against species with longer amplicons. This problem could be overcome by using the new primers, which produce shorter amplicons and better preserve the quantitative composition of the template. In addition, the new primers yielded more diverse amplicon communities than the ITS1f primer.},

However, the occurrence and dispersion of free-living dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Symbiodinium are less documented. Here ecological and molecular evidence is presented demonstrating the existence of demersal free-living Symbiodinium populations in Caribbean reefs and the possible role of the stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) as Symbiodinium spp. dispersers. Communities of free-living Symbiodinium were found within macroalgal beds consisting of Halimeda spp., Lobophora variegata, Amphiroa spp., Caulerpa spp. and Dictyota spp. Viable Symbiodinium spp. cells were isolated and cultured from macroalgal beds and S. viride feces. Further identification of Symbiodinium spp. type was determined by length variation in the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2, nuclear rDNA) and length variation in domain V of the chloroplast large subunit ribosomal DNA (cp23S-rDNA). Determination of free-living Symbiodinium and mechanisms of dispersal is important in understanding the life cycle of Symbiodinium spp.},

abstract = {Co-occurrence networks produced from microbial survey sequencing data are frequently used to identify interactions between community members. While this approach has potential to reveal ecological processes, it has been insufficiently validated due to the technical limitations inherent in studying complex microbial ecosystems. Here, we simulate multi-species microbial communities with known interaction patterns using generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics, construct co-occurrence networks, and evaluate how well networks reveal the underlying interactions, and how experimental and ecological parameters can affect network inference and interpretation. We find that co-occurrence networks can recapitulate interaction networks under certain conditions, but that they lose interpretability when the effects of habitat filtering become significant. We demonstrate that networks suffer from local hot spots of spurious correlation in the neighborhood of {\textquotedblleft}hub{\textquotedblright} species that engage in many interactions. We also identify topological features associated with keystone species in co-occurrence networks. This study provides a substantiated framework to guide environmental microbiologists in the construction and interpretation of co-occurrence networks from microbial survey datasets.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification affects a wide diversity of marine organisms and is of particular concern for vulnerable larval stages critical to population replenishment and connectivity. Whereas it is well known that ocean acidification will negatively affect a range of calcareous taxa, the study of fishes is more limited in both depth of understanding and diversity of study species. We used new 3D microcomputed tomography to conduct in situ analysis of the impact of ocean acidification on otolith (ear stone) size and density of larval cobia (Rachycentron canadum), a large, economically important, pantropical fish species that shares many life history traits with a diversity of high-value, tropical pelagic fishes. We show that 2,100 $\mu$atm partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) significantly increased not only otolith size (up to 49% greater volume and 58% greater relative mass) but also otolith density (6% higher). Estimated relative mass in 800 $\mu$atm pCO2 treatments was 14% greater, and there was a similar but nonsignificant trend for otolith size. Using a modeling approach, we demonstrate that these changes could affect auditory sensitivity including a ∼50% increase in hearing range at 2,100 $\mu$atm pCO2, which may alter the perception of auditory information by larval cobia in a high-CO2 ocean. Our results indicate that ocean acidification has a graded effect on cobia otoliths, with the potential to substantially influence the dispersal, survival, and recruitment of a pelagic fish species. These results have important implications for population maintenance/replenishment, connectivity, and conservation efforts for other valuable fish stocks that are already being deleteriously impacted by overfishing.},

abstract = {The characterization of microbial community structure via 16S rRNA gene profiling has been greatly advanced in recent years by the introduction of amplicon pyrosequencing. The possibility of barcoding gives the opportunity to massively screen multiple samples from environmental or clinical sources for community details. However, an on-going debate questions the reproducibility and semi-quantitative rigour of pyrotag sequencing, similar to the early days of community fingerprinting. In this study we demonstrate the reproducibility of bacterial 454 pyrotag sequencing over biological and technical replicates of aquifer sediment bacterial communities. Moreover, we explore the potential of recovering specific template ratios via quantitatively defined template spiking to environmental DNA. We sequenced pyrotag libraries of triplicate sediment samples taken in annual sampling campaigns at a tar oil contaminated aquifer in D{\"u}sseldorf, Germany. The abundance of dominating lineages was highly reproducible with a maximal standard deviation of {\textasciitilde}4% read abundance across biological, and {\textasciitilde}2% across technical replicates. Our workflow also allows for the linking of read abundances within defined assembled pyrotag contigs to that of specific 'in vivo' fingerprinting signatures. Thus we demonstrate that both terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and pyrotag sequencing are capable of recovering highly comparable community structure. Overall diversity was roughly double in amplicon sequencing. Pyrotag libraries were also capable of linearly recovering increasing ratios (up to 20%) of 16S rRNA gene amendments from a pure culture of Aliivibrio fisheri spiked to sediment DNA. Our study demonstrates that 454 pyrotag sequencing is a robust and reproducible method, capable of reliably recovering template abundances and overall community structure within natural microbial communities.},

abstract = {Widespread bleaching and mortality of reef-building corals occurred in the tropical eastern Pacific region during the severe and prolonged El Nmo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of 1982-83. At the height of the 10 month sea warming period, Panamanian reefs experienced 2-3 bouts of coral bleaching (1oss of symbiotic zooxanthellae), which resulted in coral death 2-4 weeks later. Coral reefs in Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia suffered up to 70-90% coral mortality; in the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), most coral reefs experienced >95% mortality. The hypothesis that sea warming caused this disturbance is supported by (a) the coincidence between the warming event and stress responses of reef organisms, (b) the correlation between the magnitude of local temperature deviations and the extent of mortality, and (c) the EI Nino simulation experiments that resulted in coral bleaching, mortality, and histopathological changes similar to those observed naturally. El Nino warming usually does not extend north of Ecuador where eastern Pacific coral reefs are best developed. A near-decadal (1976-1988) warming trend over much of the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean could have affected the susceptibility of reef corals during the short- term 1982-83 warming disturbance. Zooxanthellate corals were affected most severely in nearly all reef areas, however, other organisms -- such as benthic algae, non-zooxanthellate scleractinian corals, black corals, molluscs, barnacles, and crustacean symbiotes of corals -- often showed local negative responses associated with non-thermal, El Nino-related conditions (e.g., nutrient depletion, low plankton abundance, high sea level, and wave assault). Secondary disturbances included (a) the elimination of coral barriers, allowing the cora1livore Acanthaster planci access to formerly protected coral prey, (b) increased external bioerosion of reef surfaces killed in 1983 because ofpost-El Nino increases in sea urchin densities, and (c) the establishment of damselfish territories on corals that experienced partial mortality in 1983. Such disturbances are currently causing longer-term changes to their respective local communities. Estimates of the ages of massive corals that were killed or irreparably damaged, and the interruption of reef frameworkaccumulation suggest that a disturbance comparable to that of 1982-83 probably has not occurred in the Galapagos Islands or Panama during the past 200 years. The initial damaging effects of the 1982-83 disturbance to reef coral populations, combined with persistent secondary disturbances andlowcoralrecruitment,couldprolongreefrecoveryfordecadesorpossiblycenturies. Periods of intense upwelling cause localized and moderate levels of coral mortality, but persistent ENSO- related sea warming causes widespread and catastrophic coral mortality. El Nmo events of extreme severity may limit eastern Pacific reef growth and diversity as much as do distance and isolation of these reefs from the centers of reef development in the western Pacific.},

abstract = {Massive scleractinian corals of the genus Porites are important reef builders in the Indo-Pacific, and they are more resistant to thermal stress than other stony corals, such as the genus Acropora. Because coral health and survival largely depend on the interaction between a coral host and its symbionts, it is important to understand the molecular interactions of an entire "coral holobiont". We simultaneously sequenced transcriptomes of Porites australiensis and its symbionts using the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform. We obtained 14.3 Gbp of sequencing data and assembled it into 74,997 contigs (average: 1,263 bp, N50 size: 2,037 bp). We successfully distinguished contigs originating from the host (Porites) and the symbiont (Symbiodinium) by aligning nucleotide sequences with the decoded Acropora digitifera and Symbiodinium minutum genomes. In contrast to previous coral transcriptome studies, at least 35% of the sequences were found to have originated from the symbionts, indicating that it is possible to analyze both host and symbiont transcriptomes simultaneously. Conserved protein domain and KEGG analyses showed that the dataset contains broad gene repertoires of both Porites and Symbiodinium. Effective utilization of sequence reads revealed that the polymorphism rate in P. australiensis is 1.0% and identified the major symbiotic Symbiodinium as Type C15. Analyses of amino acid biosynthetic pathways suggested that this Porites holobiont is probably able to synthesize most of the common amino acids and that Symbiodinium is potentially able to provide essential amino acids to its host. We believe this to be the first molecular evidence of complementarity in amino acid metabolism between coral hosts and their symbionts. We successfully assembled genes originating from both the host coral and the symbiotic Symbiodinium to create a snapshot of the coral holobiont transcriptome. This dataset will facilitate a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms of coral symbioses and stress responses.},

abstract = {The genetic analysis of faecal material represents a relatively non-invasive way to study animal diet and has been widely adopted in ecological research. Due to the heterogeneous nature of faecal material the primary obstacle, common to all genetic approaches, is a means to dissect the constituent DNA sequences. Traditionally, bacterial cloning of PCR amplified products was employed; less common has been the use of species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays. Currently, with the advent of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies and indexed primers it has become possible to conduct genetic audits of faecal material to a much greater depth than previously possible. To date, no studies have systematically compared the estimates obtained by HTS with that of qPCR. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of each technique and how quantitative are deep-sequencing approaches that employ universal primers? Using the locally threatened Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) as a model organism, it is shown here that both qPCR and HTS techniques are highly correlated and produce strikingly similar quantitative estimates of fish DNA in faecal material, with no statistical difference. By designing four species-specific fish qPCR assays and comparing the data to the same four fish in the HTS data it was possible to directly compare the strengths and weaknesses of both techniques. To obtain reproducible quantitative data one of the key, and often overlooked, steps common to both approaches is ensuring that efficient DNA isolation methods are employed and that extracts are free of inhibitors. Taken together, the methodology chosen for long-term faecal monitoring programs is largely dependent on the complexity of the prey species present and the level of accuracy that is desired. Importantly, these methods should not be thought of as mutually exclusive, as the use of both HTS and qPCR in tandem will generate datasets with the highest fidelity.},

abstract = {We analyzed the usefulness of rpoA, recA, and pyrH gene sequences for the identification of vibrios. We sequenced fragments of these loci from a collection of 208 representative strains, including 192 well-documented Vibrionaceae strains and 16 presumptive Vibrio isolates associated with coral bleaching. In order to determine the intraspecies variation among the three loci, we included several representative strains per species. The phylogenetic trees constructed with the different genetic loci were roughly in agreement with former polyphasic taxonomic studies, including the 16S rRNA-based phylogeny of vibrios. The families Vibrionaceae, Photobacteriaceae, Enterovibrionaceae, and Salinivibrionaceae were all differentiated on the basis of each genetic locus. Each species clearly formed separated clusters with at least 98, 94, and 94% rpoA, recA, and pyrH gene sequence similarity, respectively. The genus Vibrio was heterogeneous and polyphyletic, with Vibrio fischeri, V logei, and V. wodanis grouping closer to the Photobacterium genus. V halioticoli-, V harveyi-, V splendidus-, and V. tubiashii-related species formed groups within the genus Vibrio. Overall, the three genetic loci were more discriminatory among species than were 16S rRNA sequences. In some cases, e.g., within the V. splendidus and V. tubiashii group, rpoA gene sequences were slightly less discriminatory than recA and pyrH sequences. In these cases, the combination of several loci will yield the most robust identification. We can conclude that strains of the same species will have at least 98, 94, and 94% rpoA, recA, and pyrH gene sequence similarity, respectively.},

Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the conversion of arginine to citrulline. Biochemical characterization of NOS from Aiptasia was characterized with respect to cellular localization, substrate and cofactor requirements, inhibitors, and kinetics. In response to acute temperature shock, anemones retracted their tentacles. Animals subjected to such stress had lower NOS activities than did controls. Treatment with NOS inhibitors caused tentacular retraction, while treatment with the NOS substrate L-arginine inhibited this response to stress, as did treatment with NO donors. These results provide a preliminary biochemical characterization of, and suggest a functional significance for, NOS activity in anthozoan-algal symbiotic assemblages.},

Feeding rates and the species composition of zooplankton captured by these species were observed in situ on a shallow patch reef at Isla Contadora, Gulf of Panama, in February (seawater temperature 20.7 degrees C) and May (seawater temperature 28.5 degrees C) 2003 at 1 and 6 m depths. Fragments of the corals Pocillopora damicornis (branching morphology, 1.0 mm diameter polyps), Pavona clavus (mounding morphology, 1.3 rum diameter polyps) and Pavona gigantea (mounding morphology, 3.0 mm diameter polyps) were collected at 3 m, transplanted to 1 and 6 rn depth on the reef, placed inside feeding chambers, and exposed to high concentrations of natural zooplankton. After feeding, coral fragments were collected, the number and type of zooplankton within 100 polyps of each counted, and feeding rates calculated cm(-2). Feeding rates increased with increasing depth, were lower during periods of upwelling, and were higher in corals with mounding morphology than in those with branching morphology. Feeding rates cm(-2) did not vary with polyp size. Assemblages of captured zooplankton did not change with upwelling, depth, morphology or polyp size. The proportionate contributions of poor-swimming and mid-sized (200 to 400 pm) zooplankton taxa eaten were over-represented relative to their abundance. When combined with prior studies, these results suggest that coral feeding rates are facultative and that feeding rates vary due to increased feeding effort and not necessarily due to increased colony morphology or polyp size.},

abstract = {The early effects of heat stress on the photosynthesis of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) within the tissues of a reef-building coral were examined using pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence and photorespirometry. Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to 33 and 34 degrees C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong non-photochemical quenching (qN) of the chlorophyll fluorescence signal, (2) marked decreases in photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of photosystern II (PSII), Quantum yield decreased to a greater extent on the illuminated surfaces of coral branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high irradiance intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33 degrees C as opposed to 28 degrees C), qN collapsed in heat-stressed samples when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen, Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat (qN) and O-2-dependent electron flow through the Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle (MAP-cycle) following the point at which the rate of light-driven electron transport exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. A model for coral bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in S, pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been observed during heat damage in higher plants, Damage to PSII and a reduction in F-v/F-m (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects following the overwhelming of photoprotective mechanisms by light. This secondary factor increases the effect of the primary variable, temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco, Significant features of our model are that (1) damage to PSII is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in zooxanthellae, acid (2) light plays a key secondary role in the initiation of the bleaching phenomena.},

abstract = {Plesiastrea versipora is a hermatypic coral with a distribution that extends to the southern limit for hermatypic corals. The normal annual temperature range for this coral in Port Phillip Bay (Victoria) (approximately 10-21 degreesC) is well below the physiological optimum for the majority of hermatypic corals (25-29 degreesC). The rate of photosynthesis and respiration in Plesiastrea generally increased with temperature before levelling out at the higher temperatures, with Q(10) data suggesting that both photosynthesis and respiration in Plesiastrea acclimate to changing temperatures. Respiration showed a similar trend to photosynthesis, with respect to temperature, but with a slightly lower rate of increase. Photosynthetic rate in Plesiastrea is comparable with that of reef corals despite lower temperatures and irradiance. When expressed as a function of chlorophyll a content photosynthesis approached perfect temperature compensation with prolonged exposure to various temperatures. Temperature-dependent changes with chlorophyll content may be responsible for temperature related changes in photosynthetic rate. This may be a mechanism for stabilising the symbiotic relationship over a wide temperature range. Autotrophic ability, estimated from photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) ratios, was greatest at higher temperatures and was only slightly less than that of reef corals. At low temperatures Plesiastrea may be dependent on heterotrophic feeding. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Infection experiments were conducted in aposymbiotic larvae of the scleractinian Fungia scutaria using known algal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)-2 types within Clade C. Our results show that algal type is directly related to specificity during the onset of symbiosis in F scutaria larvae. The 3 ITS symbiont types (C1f, C15 and C31) within the major Symbiodinium Clade C engaged differentially in symbiosis with coral larvae. The homologous symbiont (C1f), found in adult E scutaria from the field, showed a significantly better association with the host larvae than the other 2 heterologous symbionts (C15 extracted from Porites compressa, and C31 from Montipora capitata). This is the first evidence that fine-scale ITS diversity of Symbiodinium confers functionality in the symbiosis.},

abstract = {Vibrio shiloi , the causative agent of bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica in the Mediterranean Sea, is present in all bleached O. patagonica corals in the summer (25-30degreesC), but can be not detected in the coral during the winter (16-20degreesC). Furthermore, the pathogen can not survive in O. patagonica at temperatures below 20degreesC. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a V. shiloi -specific oligonucleotide probe, we found that the marine fireworm Hermodice caranculata is a winter reservoir for V. shiloi . Worms taken directly from the sea during the winter contained similar to 10(8) V. shiloi per worm by FISH analysis. However, colony-forming units (cfu) revealed only 4.1-18.3 x 10(4) V. shiloi per worm, indicating that similar to 99.9% of them were in the viable-but-not-culturable (VBNC) state. When worms were infected with V. shiloi , most of the bacteria adhered to the worm within 24 h and then penetrated into epidermal cells. By 48 h, less than 10(-4) of the intact V. shiloi in the worm gave rise to colonies, suggesting that they differentiated inside the worm into the VBNC state. When worms infected with V. shiloi were placed in aquaria containing O. patagonica , all of the corals showed small patches of bleached tissue in 7-10 days and total bleaching in 17 days. This is the first report of a reservoir and vector for a coral disease.},

abstract = {This study was aimed at detecting apoptosis as a post-phagocytic mechanism of symbiont selection during the onset of symbiosis in larvae of the scleractinian coral Fungia scutaria. Larvae were infected with one of three Symbiodinium types: freshly isolated homologous ITS-type C1f from adult F. scutaria, heterologous C31 from adult Montipora capitata, known to be unable to successfully colonize F. scutaria larvae, and type B1 from the symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia spp. Apoptosis was detected by the activation of caspases, enzymes specific to apoptosis. Caspase activity was measured in situ by cleavage of a specific fluorophore and detection with confocal microscopy. At 6 h post infection, there was a significant increase in caspase activation in gastrodermal cells in C31-infected larvae, compared with larvae infected with C1f or B1 types. Compared with control larvae infected with C31, which had decreased infection rates present by 24 h post infection, when C31-infected larvae were incubated with a broad-scale caspase inhibitor, the per cent of larvae infected with C31 did not significantly decrease over time. This indicates that the reduction in infection success observed in untreated C31-infected larvae can be rescued with inhibition of caspases and apoptosis. This suggests the presence of a post-phagocytic recognition mechanism. Larvae infected with freshly isolated B1 retained infection success over time compared with C31-infected larvae, suggesting that there is host discrimination between heterologous algae. Initiation of this post-phagocytic response may occur more readily with a highly specific heterologous symbiont type such as C31, compared with a generalist heterologous type such as clade B1.},

abstract = {The Deep Reef Refugia Hypothesis proposes that deep reefs can act as local recruitment sources for shallow reefs following disturbance. To test this hypothesis, nine polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci were developed and used to assess vertical connectivity in 583 coral colonies of the Caribbean depth-generalist coral Montastraea cavernosa. Samples were collected from three depth zones ($\le$10 m, 15-20 m and $\ge$25 m) at sites in Florida Upper Keys, Lower Keys and Dry Tortugas), Bermuda, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Migration rates were estimated to determine the probability of coral larval migration from shallow to deep and from deep to shallow. Finally, algal symbiont (Symbiodinium spp.) diversity and distribution was assessed in a subset of corals to test whether symbiont depth zonation might indicate limited vertical connectivity. Overall, analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation by depth in Florida, but not in Bermuda or the U.S. Virgin Islands, despite high levels of horizontal connectivity between these geographic locations at shallow depths. Within Florida, greater vertical connectivity was observed in the Dry Tortugas compared to the Lower or Upper Keys. However, at all sites, and regardless of the extent of vertical connectivity, migration occurred asymmetrically, with greater likelihood of migration from shallow to intermediate/deep habitats. Finally, most colonies hosted a single Symbiodinium type (C3), ruling out symbiont depth zonation of the dominant symbiont type as a structuring factor. Together, these findings suggest that the potential for shallow reefs to recover from deep-water refugia in M. cavernosa is location-specific; varying among and within geographic locations likely as a consequence of local hydrology.

abstract = {Reef-building corals inhabit high light environments and are dependent on photosynthetic endosymbiotic dinoflagellates for nutrition. While photoacclimation responses of the dinoflagellates to changes in illumination are well understood, host photoacclimation strategies are poorly known. This study investigated fluorescent protein expression in the shallow-water coral Acropora yongei during a 30 day laboratory photoacclimation experiment in the context of its dinoflagellate symbionts. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) concentration measured by Western blotting changed reversibly with light intensity. The first 15 days of the photoacclimation experiment led to a ∼1.6 times increase in GFP concentration for high light corals (900 $\mu$mol quanta m⁻{\texttwosuperior} s⁻{\textonesuperior}) and a ∼4 times decrease in GFP concentration for low light corals (30 $\mu$mol quanta m⁻{\texttwosuperior} s⁻{\textonesuperior}) compared with medium light corals (300 $\mu$mol quanta m⁻{\texttwosuperior} s⁻{\textonesuperior}). Green fluorescence increased ∼1.9 times in high light corals and decreased ∼1.9 times in low light corals compared with medium light corals. GFP concentration and green fluorescence intensity were significantly correlated. Typical photoacclimation responses in the dinoflagellates were observed including changes in density, photosynthetic pigment concentration and photosynthetic efficiency. Although fluorescent proteins are ubiquitous and abundant in scleractinian corals, their functions remain ambiguous. These results suggest that scleractinian corals regulate GFP to modulate the internal light environment and support the hypothesis that GFP has a photoprotective function. The success of photoprotection and photoacclimation strategies, in addition to stress responses, will be critical to the fate of scleractinian corals exposed to climate change and other stressors.},

NH4+ was first assimilated into C-14-glutamate and C-14-glutamine in the zooxanthellae residing in A. pulchella. The specific activities (dpm nmol(-1)) of C-14-glutamate and C-14-glutamine in vivo, were far greater in the zooxanthellae than in the host tissue, indicating that NH4+ was principally incorporated into the glutamate and glutamine pools of the zooxanthellae. C-14-alpha-ketoglutarate was taken up from the medium by intact A. pulchella and assimilated into a small amount of C-14-glutamate in the host tissue, but no C-14-glutamine was detected in the host fraction. The C-14-glutamate that was synthesized was most likely produced from transamination reactions as opposed to the direct assimilation of NH4+. The free aminoacid composition of the host tissue and zooxanthellae of A. pulchella was also measured. The results presented here demonstrate that NH4+ was initially assimilated by the zooxanthellae of A. pulchella.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching events are globally occurring more frequently and with higher intensity, mainly caused by increases in seawater temperature. In Tayrona National Natural Park (TNNP) in the Colombian Caribbean, local coral communities are subjected to seasonal wind-triggered upwelling events coinciding with stronger water currents depending on location. This natural phenomenon offers the unique opportunity to study potential water current-induced mitigation mechanisms of coral bleaching in an upwelling influenced region. Therefore, coral bleaching susceptibility and recovery patterns were compared during a moderate and a mild bleaching event in December 2010 and 2011, and at the end of the subsequent upwelling periods at a water current-exposed and -sheltered site of an exemplary bay using permanent transect and labeling tools. This was accompanied by parallel monitoring of key environmental variables. Findings revealed that in 2010 overall coral bleaching before upwelling was significantly higher at the sheltered (34%) compared to the exposed site (8%). Whereas 97% of all previously bleached corals at the water current-exposed site had recovered from bleaching by April 2011, only 77% recovered at the sheltered site, but 12% had died there. In December 2011, only mild bleaching ({\&}lt;10% at both sites) was observed, but corals recovered significantly at both sites in the course of upwelling. No differences in water temperatures between sites occurred, but water current exposure and turbidity were significantly higher at the exposed site, suggesting that these variables may be responsible for the observed site-specific mitigation of coral bleaching. This indicates the existence of local resilience patterns against coral bleaching in Caribbean reefs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Physiologically based modelling using DEBtox (dynamic energy budget in toxicology) and transcriptional profiling were used in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify how physiological modes of action, as indicated by effects on system level resource allocation were associated with changes in gene expression following exposure to three toxic chemicals: cadmium, fluoranthene (FA) and atrazine (AZ).

RESULTS:For Cd, the physiological mode of action as indicated by DEBtox model fitting was an effect on energy assimilation from food, suggesting that the transcriptional response to exposure should be dominated by changes in the expression of transcripts associated with energy metabolism and the mitochondria. While evidence for effect on genes associated with energy production were seen, an ontological analysis also indicated an effect of Cd exposure on DNA integrity and transcriptional activity. DEBtox modelling showed an effect of FA on costs for growth and reproduction (i.e. for production of new and differentiated biomass). The microarray analysis supported this effect, showing an effect of FA on protein integrity and turnover that would be expected to have consequences for rates of somatic growth. For AZ, the physiological mode of action predicted by DEBtox was increased cost for maintenance. The transcriptional analysis demonstrated that this increase resulted from effects on DNA integrity as indicated by changes in the expression of genes chromosomal repair.

CONCLUSIONS:Our results have established that outputs from process based models and transcriptomics analyses can help to link mechanisms of action of toxic chemicals with resulting demographic effects. Such complimentary analyses can assist in the categorisation of chemicals for risk assessment purposes.},

abstract = {Marine sponges can harbor dense and diverse bacterial communities, yet we have a limited understanding of important aspects of this symbiosis. We developed an experimental methodology that permits manipulating the composition of the microbial community. Specifically, we evaluated sponge cell aggregates (SCA) from Clathria prolifera that had been treated with different classes of antibiotics to determine whether this system might offer novel experimental approaches to the study of sponge/bacterial symbioses. Microscopic analysis of the SCA demonstrated that two distinct morphological types of microbiota existed on the external surface vs. the internal regions of the SCA. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries indicated that we were unable to create entirely aposymbiotic SCA but that different classes of antibiotics produced distinctive shifts in the SCA-associated bacterial community. After exposure to antibiotics, some bacterial species were 'revealed', thus uncovering novel components of the sponge-associated community. The antibiotic treatments used here had little discernible effect on the formation of SCA or subsequent development of the adult. The experimental approach we describe offers empirical options for studying the role symbionts play in sponge growth and development and for ascertaining relationships among bacterial species in communities residing in sponges.},

abstract = {The reproductive ecology of Tubastraea coccinea Lesson, an azooxanthellate tropical scleractinian coral, was studied over various periods from 1985 to 2006 at four principal eastern Pacific locations in Costa Rica, Panamai, and the Galaipagos Islands (Ecuador). This small (polyp diameter 0.8-1.0 cm), relatively cryptic species produced ova and planulae year round, including colonies with as few as 2-10 polyps. Of 424 colonies examined histologically, 13.7% contained both ova and sperm. Mature ova varied in diameter from similar to 300 to 800 mu m and the time from spawning and fertilization of oocytes to release of brooded planulae was about 6 weeks. Planulae were 0.5-1.5 mm long and they settled and metamorphosed on a variety of substrates after 1-3 days. Spermaries, though more difficult to distinguish in histological sections, were present throughout the year. Spent spermaries were never observed in sections, but several colonies in Panamai and the Galaipagos Islands released sperm from night one to night five after full moon, indicating the potential for cross-fertilization among colonies. Planula release was observed at Uva Island (Panamai) in March, May, June, and July, and in general planula presence was higher at warm ocean temperatures at all sites, whether or not the sites were influenced by seasonal upwelling. Annual fecundity estimates for T. coccinea are comparable with other high fecundity brooding species, including the zooxanthellate Porites panamensis, with which it co-occurs in Panamai. Tubastraea coccinea is widely distributed in the tropical Indo-Pacific and has colonized substrates in the western Atlantic. In addition to the reproductive characteristics described in the present study, other features of the biology of T. coccinea, such as an ability to withstand conditions that produce bleaching and mortality in zooxanthellate species, may account for its widespread, low-latitude distribution in multiple oceans.},

Across a large depth gradient (5-40 m) and for four Madracis species and three symbiont genotypes, we assessed several variables by measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence, photosynthetic pigment composition, or symbiont population descriptors. Most of the variation is explained by two major photobiological components: light-use efficiency and symbiont cell densities. Two other minor components emphasize photoprotective pathways and light-harvesting properties such as secondary pigments. Statistics highlight the role of irradiance on coral physiology and reveal mechanisms that are either genetically constrained, such as symbiont cell sizes, or environmentally dependent, such as photochemical efficiencies. Other parameters, such as cellular light-harvesting and photoprotective pigment concentrations, are regulated by host, symbiont, and environment. The interaction between host and environment stresses the role of host properties in adjusting the internal environment available for the endosymbionts. Different holobiont strategies, relating to symbiont cell density, vary in their physiological optimization of light-harvesting or photoprotective mechanisms and link to host-species distribution and dominance over the reef slope. Symbiont functional diversity appears to have a significant role but does not explain host vertical distribution patterns per se, highlighting the importance of species-specific morphological and physiological properties of the coral host.},

We tested for potential effects of feeding on phloem colonized by fungi on beetle performance in field and laboratory studies. The fungi increased nitrogen levels in the phloem of attacked trees by 40%, indicating that it may be an important source of dietary nitrogen for mountain pine beetles. However, nitrogen levels of phloem inoculated with fungi in the laboratory were similar to uncolonized phloem, indicating that the fungi may redistribute nitrogen from the sapwood to the phloem rather than increase absolute levels of nitrogen. Beetles emerging from attacked trees carrying G. clavigera were larger than beetles carrying O. montium, which in turn were larger than beetles lacking fungi. Results of experimental laboratory studies varied, likely because of differences in the growth and sporulation of fungi under artificial conditions. Results indicate that the two fungi may offer complementary benefits to the mountain pine beetle because larvae preferentially fed on phloem colonized by both fungi together over phloem colonized by one fungus or uncolonized phloem. Teneral adults preemergence fed on spores in pupal chambers when they were produced and consumed little phloem before emerging. Teneral adults mined extensively in the phloem before emerging when spores were not produced in the pupal chamber. Our results provide evidence for a nutritional role of fungi in the diet of bark beetles and show that multiple associates may differentially affect beetle performance, which could have important implications for bark beetle population dynamics.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Chimeric DNA sequences often form during polymerase chain reaction amplification, especially when sequencing single regions (e.g. 16S rRNA or fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer) to assess diversity or compare populations. Undetected chimeras may be misinterpreted as novel species, causing inflated estimates of diversity and spurious inferences of differences between populations. Detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments.

RESULTS:We describe UCHIME, a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments. UCHIME either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. UCHIME has better sensitivity than ChimeraSlayer (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences. In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known composition, UCHIME de novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to Perseus. UCHIME is >100{\texttimes} faster than Perseus and >1000{\texttimes} faster than ChimeraSlayer.

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has caused a revolution in biology. NGS requires the preparation of libraries in which (fragments of) DNA or RNA molecules are fused with adapters followed by PCR amplification and sequencing. It is evident that robust library preparation methods that produce a representative, non-biased source of nucleic acid material from the genome under investigation are of crucial importance. Nevertheless, it has become clear that NGS libraries for all types of applications contain biases that compromise the quality of NGS datasets and can lead to their erroneous interpretation. A detailed knowledge of the nature of these biases will be essential for a careful interpretation of NGS data on the one hand and will help to find ways to improve library quality or to develop bioinformatics tools to compensate for the bias on the other hand. In this review we discuss the literature on bias in the most common NGS library preparation protocols, both for DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) as well as for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Strikingly, almost all steps of the various protocols have been reported to introduce bias, especially in the case of RNA-seq, which is technically more challenging than DNA-seq. For each type of bias we discuss methods for improvement with a view to providing some useful advice to the researcher who wishes to convert any kind of raw nucleic acid into an NGS library.},

abstract = {We introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},

With this increased sensitivity and the ability to analyze multiple samples in parallel, it has become possible to evaluate several technical aspects of PCR-based community structure profiling methods. We tested the effect of amplicon length and primer pair on estimates of species richness (number of species) and evenness (relative abundance of species) by assessing the potentially tractable microbial community residing in the termite hindgut. Two regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced from one of two common priming sites, spanning the V1-V2 or V8 regions, using amplicons ranging in length from 352 to 1443 bp. Our results show that both amplicon length and primer pair markedly influence estimates of richness and evenness. However, estimates of species evenness are consistent among different primer pairs targeting the same region. These results highlight the importance of experimental methodology when comparing diversity estimates across communities.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals begin as non-calcifying larvae that, upon settling, rapidly begin to accrete skeleton and a protein-rich skeletal organic matrix that attach them to the reef. Here, we characterized the temporal and spatial expression pattern of a suite of biomineralization genes during three stages of larval development in the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis: stage I, newly released; stage II, oral-aborally compressed and stage III, settled and calcifying spat. Transcriptome analysis revealed 3882 differentially expressed genes that clustered into four distinctly different patterns of expression change across the three developmental stages. Immunolocalization analysis further reveals the spatial arrangement of coral acid-rich proteins (CARPs) in the overall architecture of the emerging skeleton. These results provide the first analysis of the timing of the biomineralization 'toolkit' in the early life history of a stony coral.},

abstract = {The coral pathogen Vibrio shiloi was present during the summer in the tissues of all of its host corals, Oculina patagonica, which were bleached. During the winter, when seawater temperatures dropped below 20 degreesC, V shiloi could not be detected in either healthy or bleached corals, even when the corals were placed in aquaria and the temperature was slowly increased to 28 degreesC. Using specific anti-V shiloi antibodies to enumerate the bacterium, it was shown that 99 to 99.99% of V; shiloi inside coral tissues were in a viable-but-not-culturable (VBNC) state. All attempts to culture VBNC V.shiloi in liquid or on solid media were unsuccessful. However, it was demonstrated that VBNC V. shiloi was infectious, i.e., it adhered to, penetrated into and multiplied inside corals. Laboratory aquaria experiments indicated that when corals were infected with V. shiloi at 28 degreesC and then shifted slowly to their winter in situ temperature (16 degreesC), the bacteria died and lysed. Since the bacteria remain viable under the same temperature shifts outside the coral, either in growth media or seawater, it follows that the coral must have a host-defense mechanism for killing intracellular bacteria. The rapid killing of intracellular V shiloi at 16 degreesC and their absence from corals during the winter suggest that bleaching of O. patagonica in the Mediterranean Sea requires a fresh infection each spring, rather than the activation of dormant intracellular bacteria. The lessons learned from the V shiloi/ O. patagonica model systems are discussed in terms of the general problem of the coral bleaching disease.},

abstract = {Decades-long records of the stable isotopic composition of coral skeletal cores were analyzed from four sites on the Mesoamerican Reef. Two of the sites exhibited baseline shifts in oxygen isotopic composition after known coral bleaching events. Changes in pH at the calcification site caused by a change in the associated symbiont community are invoked to explain the observed shift in the isotopic composition. To test the hypothesis that changes in symbiont clade could affect skeletal chemistry, additional coral samples were collected from Belize for paired Symbiodinium identification and skeletal stable isotopic analysis. We found some evidence that skeletal stable isotopic composition may be affected by symbiont clade and suggest this is an important topic for future investigation. If different Symbiodinium clades leave con- sistent signatures in skeletal geochemical composition, the signature will provide a method to quantify past symbiont shuffling events, important for understanding how corals are likely to respond to climate change.},

abstract = {Coral reef ecosystems are based on coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis. During the initiation of symbiosis, majority of corals acquire their own zooxanthellae (specifically from the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium) from surrounding environments. The mechanisms underlying the initial establishment of symbiosis have attracted much interest, and numerous field and laboratory experiments have been conducted to elucidate this establishment. However, it is still unclear whether the host corals selectively or randomly acquire their symbionts from surrounding environments. To address this issue, we initially compared genetic compositions of Symbiodinium within naturally settled about 2-week-old Acropora coral juveniles (recruits) and those in the adjacent seawater as the potential symbiont source. We then performed infection tests using several types of Symbiodinium culture strains and apo-symbiotic (does not have Symbiodinium cells yet) Acropora coral larvae. Our field observations indicated apparent preference toward specific Symbiodinium genotypes (A1 and D1-4) within the recruits, despite a rich abundance of other Symbiodinium in the environmental population pool. Laboratory experiments were in accordance with this field observation: Symbiodinium strains of type A1 and D1-4 showed higher infection rates for Acropora larvae than other genotype strains, even when supplied at lower cell densities. Subsequent attraction tests revealed that three Symbiodinium strains were attracted toward Acropora larvae, and within them, only A1 and D1-4 strains were acquired by the larvae. Another three strains did not intrinsically approach to the larvae. These findings suggest the initial establishment of corals-Symbiodinium symbiosis is not random, and the infection mechanism appeared to comprise two steps: initial attraction step and subsequent selective uptake by the coral.},

abstract = {Reproductive development of anthozoans reveals wide range of breeding strategies. Here, we report the occurrence of trioecy in the sea anemone Aiptasia diaphana (co-occurrence of males, females, and hermaphrodites), which so far was well documented only in plants. Age-homogeneous populations were obtained from pedal lacerates (asexual propagules) and cultured under control conditions. Careful documentation of growth, gamete morphology, and vertebrate-like steroid (i.e., progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol) levels were carried out over a 9-wk period between 4 and 12 wk postlaceration (wpl). First phenotypic signs of gametes development were observed in 6-wk-old anemones, pointing to the differentiation of males and hermaphrodites. While the males exhibited cellular progression of spermatogenesis, the hermaphrodites underwent a process of sex allocation, giving rise to male, female, and hermaphrodite phenotypes. Testosterone levels were relatively high prior to gamete appearance (4 wpl) and later on during gamete maturation (10 wpl). Conversely, estradiol levels steadily increased from 6 to 10 wpl, reaching their peak concomitant with oocyte maturation. Interestingly, increased oocyte atresia incidences were recorded during 9-12 wpl, coinciding with declining levels of steroid hormones. These results point to a strong similarity between the activity of sex steroids in vertebrates and that of vertebrate-like sex steroids on critical stages of A. diaphana's sexual differentiation and gametogenic cycle. The reproductive characteristics of A. diaphana make this anthozoan an important model species for the study of evolutionary drivers and processes underlying sexual development.},

abstract = {The metabolite exchange in alga-invertebrate symbioses has been the subject of extensive research. A central question is how the biomass of the algal endosymbionts is maintained within defined limits under a given set of environmental conditions despite their tremendous growth potential. Whether algal growth is actively regulated by the animal cells is still an open question. We experimentally evaluated the effect of inorganic nutrient supply and host-animal nutritional status on the biomass composition, growth and cell-cycle kinetics of the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium pulchrorum (Trench) in the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella. Dinoflagellates in anemones starved for 14 d exhibited lower growth rates, chlorophyll content and higher C:N ratios than in anemones fed Artemia sp. (San Francisco brand {\#}65034) nauplii every 2 d, indicating N-limitation of the algae during starvation of the host animal. Manipulation of the dissolved inorganic nutrient supply through ammonium and phosphate additions induced a rapid recovery (half time, t(1/2) similar to 2 d) in the C:N ratio of the dinoflagellate cells to levels characteristic of N-sufficient cells. The mitotic index and population growth rate of the dinoflagellate symbionts subjected to this enrichment did not recover to the levels exhibited in fed associations. Flow cytometric analysis of dinoflagellate cell size and DNA content revealed that the duration of the G(1) phase (first peak of DNA content: 70 to 100 relative fluorescence units, rfu) of their cell cycle lengthened dramatically in the symbiotic state, and that the majority of algal biomass increase occurred during this phase. Covariate analysis of dinoflagellate cell size and DNA-content distributions indicated that the symbiotic state is associated with a nutrient-independent constraint on cell progression from G(1) through the S phase (intermediate DNA content: 101 to 139 rfu). This analysis suggests that the host-cell environment may set the upper limit on the rate of dinoflagellate cell-cycle progression and thereby coordinate the relative growth rates of the autotrophic and heterotrophic partners in this symbiotic association.},

abstract = {The potentially lethal bleaching of invertebrates through loss of their algal symbionts is a major global conservation issue; cnidarians in such interactions could potentially withstand environmental change by having multiple symbiotic partners whose physiologies vary with critical field parameters such as temperature and light. Spatial variation in symbiont distributions in the field is a strong indicator of such potential. We show that, in an association between an abundant temperate sea anemone and its two endosymbionts, the dinophyte Symbiodinium muscatinei (zooxanthellae) and an unidentified green alga (zoochlorellae), densities and ratios of anemones' symbionts change along a light gradient generated by intertidal caves in Washington state. In the laboratory, the photosynthetic performance of zooxanthellate anemones exceeded that of zoochlorellate anemones under high irradiance levels (>100 tmol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). Further, field sampling revealed that caves are divided into three distinct regions based on anemones' algal complements: a brown region of zooxanthellate anemones near the mouth of the cave, a green region of zoochlorellate anemones in the middle of the cave, and a white region of algae-free anemones near the back of the cave. These data, together with field reciprocal transplant experiments showing algae-free anemones' ability to regrow algae consistent with local physical conditions, suggest that algal performance (vs. host selection) determines observed variation in these symbioses. Our results support the idea that temperate, as well as tropical, host-symbiont associations can respond plastically to environmental change. Our data also suggest that intact symbioses in adult hosts are surprisingly stable; bleaching may be required in rearranging host-symbiont associations.},

Yet, it is unknown whether such resource stratification allows for physiological differences of Symbiodinium within coral tissues. Using a combination of stable isotope labelling and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry, we investigated in hospite carbon fixation of individual Symbiodinium as a function of the local O2 and light microenvironment within the coral host determined with microsensors. We found that net carbon fixation rates of individual Symbiodinium cells differed on average about sixfold between upper and lower tissue layers of single coral polyps, whereas the light and O2 microenvironments differed {\textasciitilde}15- and 2.5-fold, respectively, indicating differences in light utilisation efficiency along the light microgradient within the coral tissue. Our study suggests that the structure of coral tissues might be conceptually similar to photosynthetic biofilms, where steep physico-chemical gradients define form and function of the local microbial community.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 4 August 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.133.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification is expected to lower the net accretion of coral reefs yet little is known about its effect on coral photophysiology. This study investigated the effect of increasing CO2 on photosynthetic capacity and photoprotection in Acropora formosa. The photoprotective role of photorespiration within dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) has largely been overlooked due to focus on the presence of a carbon-concentrating mechanism despite the evolutionary persistence of a Form II Rubisco. The photorespiratory fixation of oxygen produces phosphoglycolate that would otherwise inhibit carbon fixation though the Calvin cycle if it were not converted to glycolate by phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGPase). Glycolate is then either excreted or dealt with by enzymes in the photorespiratory glycolate and/or glycerate pathways adding to the pool of carbon fixed in photosynthesis. We found that CO2 enrichment led to enhanced photoacclimation (increased chlorophyll a per cell) to the subsaturating light levels. Light-enhanced dark respiration per cell and xanthophyll de-epoxidation increased, with resultant decreases in photosynthetic capacity (P-nmax) per chlorophyll. The conservative CO2 emission scenario (A1B; 600-790 ppm) led to a 38% increase in the P-nmax per cell whereas the 'business-as-usual' scenario (A1F1; 1160-1500 ppm) led to a 45% reduction in PGPase expression and no change in P-nmax per cell. These findings support an important functional role for PGPase in dinoflagellates that is potentially compromised under CO2 enrichment.},

abstract = {Coral reefs provide habitats for a disproportionate number of marine species relative to the small area of the oceans that they occupy. The mutualism between the cnidarian animal hosts and their intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts provides the nutritional foundation for coral growth and formation of reef structures, because algal photosynthesis can provide >90% of the total energy of the host. Disruption of this symbiosis ("coral bleaching") is occurring on a large scale due primarily to anthropogenic factors and poses a major threat to the future of coral reefs. Despite the importance of this symbiosis, the cellular mechanisms involved in its establishment, maintenance, and breakdown remain largely unknown. We report our continued development of genomic tools to study these mechanisms in Aiptasia, a small sea anemone with great promise as a model system for studies of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Specifically, we have generated de novo assemblies of the transcriptomes of both a clonal line of symbiotic anemones and their endogenous dinoflagellate symbionts. We then compared transcript abundances in animals with and without dinoflagellates. This analysis identified >900 differentially expressed genes and allowed us to generate testable hypotheses about the cellular functions affected by symbiosis establishment. The differentially regulated transcripts include >60 encoding proteins that may play roles in transporting various nutrients between the symbiotic partners; many more encoding proteins functioning in several metabolic pathways, providing clues regarding how the transported nutrients may be used by the partners; and several encoding proteins that may be involved in host recognition and tolerance of the dinoflagellate.},

Consequently, the primary source of information about a fundamental evolutionary topic, life's diversity, is the environmental distribution of gene sequences. We report the most comprehensive analysis of the environmental distribution of bacteria to date, based on 21,752 16S rRNA sequences compiled from 111 studies of diverse physical environments. We clustered the samples based on similarities in the phylogenetic lineages that they contain and found that, surprisingly, the major environmental determinant of microbial community composition is salinity rather than extremes of temperature, pH, or other physical and chemical factors represented in our samples. We find that sediments are more phylogenetically diverse than any other environment type. Surprisingly, soil, which has high species-level diversity, has below-average phylogenetic diversity. This work provides a framework for understanding the impact of environmental factors on bacterial evolution and for the direction of future sequencing efforts to discover new lineages.},

Scleractinian corals have many different color types in water. All the colors become bleached when the coral is under stress. The pigment changes behind these phenomena were investigated in the study. Analysis of pigment composition in four color types of seven stony coral species showed chi. a, chi. c(2), peridinin, diadinoxanthin and dinoxanthin comprised more than 95% of the total amount of pigments. There was little compositional difference between these pigments in corals of different color. During bleaching caused by salinity change, both the number of zooxanthella in each polyp and the amount of total pigment in each zooxanthellae decreased with time. The rate of decline of porphyrins coincided with the level of stress that was created by lowering the salinity of the incubation sea water. The rate of decline of carotenoids was less sensitive. This suggests that the rate of change of porphyrins could reflect the bleaching status of stony coral.},

abstract = {Light-enhanced calcification is a general characteristic of zooxanthellate corals, suggesting a link between calcification by the coral and photosynthesis by the zooxanthellae, but the relationship between zooxanthellae and coral hosts during this process has not been elucidated. We hypothesized that the effects of tissue injury on the coral fragments used in experiments studying calcification might obscure that link. To detect the effects of tissue injury on light-enhanced calcification, we measured calcification rates (sclerite formation) in the soft coral Cladiella sp. by the alkalinity anomaly method during a 36-day experiment following injury associated with coral fragmentation. In the 2 weeks after colony fragmentation, the calcification response did not show a relation with light intensity. The typical light-enhanced calcification pattern was not noticed until day 15 of tissue recovery. The calcification rate of this soft coral increased with light intensity and time of tissue recovery and was comparable to that of hard corals exposed to similar experimental conditions. However, Cladiella sp. decalcified in the dark. The diurnal calcification-decalcification cycles probably control sclerite size and shape.},

abstract = {Symbiotic dinoflagellate algae residing inside coral tissues supply the host with the majority of their energy requirements through the translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon. The algae, in turn, rely on the host for the supply of inorganic carbon. Carbon must be concentrated as CO2 in order for photosynthesis to proceed, and here we show that the coral host plays an active role in this process. The host-derived symbiosome membrane surrounding the algae abundantly expresses vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (VHA), which acidifies the symbiosome space down to pH ∼4. Inhibition of VHA results in a significant decrease in average H(+) activity in the symbiosome of up to 75% and a significant reduction in O2 production rate, a measure of photosynthetic activity. These results suggest that host VHA is part of a previously unidentified carbon concentrating mechanism for algal photosynthesis and provide mechanistic evidence that coral host cells can actively modulate the physiology of their symbionts.},

abstract = {The number of complete and draft genomes is rapidly growing in recent years, and it has become increasingly important to automate the identification of functional properties and biological roles of genes in these genomes. In the KEGG database, genes in complete genomes are annotated with the KEGG orthology (KO) identifiers, or the K numbers, based on the best hit information using Smith-Waterman scores as well as by the manual curation. Each K number represents an ortholog group of genes, and it is directly linked to an object in the KEGG pathway map or the BRITE functional hierarchy. Here, we have developed a web-based server called KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server: http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/) i.e. an implementation of a rapid method to automatically assign K numbers to genes in the genome, enabling reconstruction of KEGG pathways and BRITE hierarchies. The method is based on sequence similarities, bi-directional best hit information and some heuristics, and has achieved a high degree of accuracy when compared with the manually curated KEGG GENES database.},

Radioactivity was recovered from all amino acids in the protein hydrolysates of A. pulchella bearing the symbiotic alga Symbiodinium sp., and from all but seven of the amino acids in A. pulchella experimentally deprived of their algae. These data suggest that these seven amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and valine) may be synthesized by the symbiotic algae and translocated to the sea anemone's tissues; and that methionine and threonine, two amino acids traditionally considered as dietary essentials for animals, are synthesized by A. pulchella. Essential amino acid translocation from the symbiotic algae to the animal host is a core element in symbiotic nitrogen-recycling. Its nutritional value to the animal host is considered in the context of the amino acid biosynthetic capacity of the host.},

abstract = {A rationale is presented here for a primary role of bleaching in regulation of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis under conditions of stress. Corals and zooxanthellae have fundamentally different metabolic rates, requiring active homeostasis to limit zooxanthellae production and manage translocated products to maintain the symbiosis. The control processes for homeostasis are compromised by environmental stress, resulting in metabolic imbalance between the symbionts. For the coral-zooxanthella symbiosis the most direct way to minimize metabolic imbalance under stress is to reduce photosynthetic production by zooxanthellae. Two mechanisms have been demonstrated that do this: reduction of the chlorophyll concentration in individual zooxanthellae and reduction of the relative biomass of zooxanthellae. Both mechanisms result in visual whitening of the coral, termed bleaching. Arguments are presented here that bleaching provides the final control to minimize physiological damage from stress as an adversity response to metabolic imbalance. As such, bleaching meets the requirements of a stress response syndrome/general adaptive mechanism that is sensitive to internal states rather than external parameters. Variation in bleaching responses among holobionts reflects genotypic and phenotypic differentiation, allowing evolutionary change by natural selection. Thus, reef corals bleach to resist stress, and thereby have some capacity to adapt to and survive change. The extreme thermal anomalies causing mass coral bleaching worldwide lie outside the reaction norms for most coral-zooxanthellae holobionts, revealing the limitations of bleaching as a control mechanism.

abstract = {Gorgonians are one of the most characteristic groups in Caribbean coral reef communities. In this study, we measured in situ rates of grazing on pico-, nano-, and microplankton, zooxanthellae release, and respiration for the ubiquitous symbiotic gorgonian coral Plexaura flexuosa. Zooplankton capture by P. flexuosa and Pseudoplexaura porosa was quantified by examination of stomach contents. In nature, both species captured zooplankton prey ranging from 100 to 700 mu m, at a grazing rate of 0.09 and 0.23 prey polyp(-1) d(-1), respectively. Because of the greater mean size of the prey and the higher mean prey capture per polyp, P. porosa obtained 3.4 X 10(-5) mg C pply p(-1) d(-1) from zooplankton, about four times the grazing rate of P. flexuosa. On average, P. flexuosa captured 7.2 +/- 1.9 microorganisms poly p(-1) d(-1) including ciliates, dinoflagellates, and diatoms, but they did not appear to graze significantly on organisms <5 mu m (heterotrophic bacteria, Prochlorococcus sp., Synechococcus sp., or picoeukaryotes). Zooplankton and microbial prey accounted for only 0.4% of respiratory requirements in P. flexuosa, but they contributed 17% of nitrogen required annually for new production (growth and reproduction). Although the contribution of microbial prey to gorgonian energetics was low, dense gorgonian populations found on many Caribbean reefs may be important grazers of plankton communities.},

The results indicate that host diet and phylogeny both influence bacterial diversity, which increases from carnivory to omnivory to herbivory; that bacterial communities codiversified with their hosts; and that the gut microbiota of humans living a modern life-style is typical of omnivorous primates.},

Beginning,vith a clonal, founding population, independently evolved strains were obtained from three independent cultures after continuous aerobic growth in glucose-limited chemostats for more than 250 generations. DNA microarrays were used to compare genome-wide patterns of gene expression in the evolved strains and the parental strain. Several hundred genes were found to have significantly altered expression in the evolved strains, Many of these genes showed similar alterations in their expression in all three evolved strains, Genes with altered expression in the three evolved strains included genes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolite transport. These results are consistent with physiological observations and indicate that increased fitness is acquired by altering regulation of central metabolism such that less glucose is fermented and more glucose is completely oxidized.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification describes the progressive, global reduction in seawater pH that is currently underway because of the accelerating oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2. Acidification is expected to reduce coral reef calcification and increase reef dissolution. Inorganic cementation in reefs describes the precipitation of CaCO3 that acts to bind framework components and occlude porosity. Little is known about the effects of ocean acidification on reef cementation and whether changes in cementation rates will affect reef resistance to erosion. Coral reefs of the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) are poorly developed and subject to rapid bioerosion. Upwelling processes mix cool, subthermocline waters with elevated pCO(2) (the partial pressure of CO2) and nutrients into the surface layers throughout the ETP. Concerns about ocean acidification have led to the suggestion that this region of naturally low pH waters may serve as a model of coral reef development in a high-CO2 world. We analyzed seawater chemistry and reef framework samples from multiple reef sites in the ETP and found that a low carbonate saturation state (Omega) and trace abundances of cement are characteristic of these reefs. These low cement abundances may be a factor in the high bioerosion rates previously reported for ETP reefs, although elevated nutrients in upwelled waters may also be limiting cementation and/or stimulating bioerosion. ETP reefs represent a real-world example of coral reef growth in low-Omega waters that provide insights into how the biological-geological interface of coral reef ecosystems will change in a high-CO2 world.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching has been identified as one of the major contributors to coral reef decline, and the occurrence of different symbionts determined by broad genetic groupings (clades A-H) is commonly used to explain thermal responses of reef-building corals. By using Stylophora pistillata as a model, we monitored individual tagged colonies in situ over a two-year period and show that fine level genetic variability within clade C is correlated to differences in bleaching susceptibility. Based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the internal transcribed spacer region 2, visual bleaching assessments, symbiont densities, host protein, and pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry, we show that subcladal types C78 and C8/a are more thermally tolerant than C79 and C35/a, which suffered significant bleaching and postbleaching mortality. Although additional symbiont types were detected during bleaching in colonies harboring types C79 and C35/a, all colonies reverted back to their original symbionts postbleaching. Most importantly, the data propose that the differential mortality of hosts harboring thermally sensitive versus resistant symbionts rather than symbiont shuffling/switching within a single host is responsible for the observed symbiont composition changes of coral communities after bleaching. This study therefore highlights that the use of broad cladal designations may not be suitable to describe differences in bleaching susceptibility, and that differential mortality results in a loss of both symbiont and host genetic diversity and therefore represents an important mechanism in explaining how coral reef communities may respond to changing conditions.},

abstract = {Oil dispersants, the tool of choice for treating oil spills in tropical marine environments, is potentially harmful to marine life, including reef corals. In a previous study, we found that dispersed oil and oil dispersants are harmful to soft and hard coral species at early life stages. In this broader study, we employed a "nubbin assay" on more than 10 000 coral fragments to evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of dispersed oil fractions (DOFs) from six commercial dispersants, the dispersants and water-soluble-fractions (WSFs) of Egyptian crude oil, on two Indo Pacific branching coral species, Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora damicornis. Survivorship and growth of nubbins were recorded for up to 50 days following a single, short (24 h) exposure to toxicants in various concentrations. Manufacturer-recommended dispersant concentrations proved to be highly toxic and resulted in mortality for all nubbins. The dispersed oil and the dispersants were significantly more toxic than crude oil WSFs. As corals are particularly susceptible to oil detergents and dispersed oil, the results of these assays rules out the use of any oil dispersant in coral reefs and in their vicinity. The ecotoxicological impacts of the various dispersants on the corals could be rated on a scale from the least to the most harmful agent, as follows: Slickgone > Petrotech > Inipol = Biorieco > Emulgal > Dispolen.},

abstract = {Evidence is presented for the photochemical formation of singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) in air-saturated aqueous solutions of several sunscreen active ingredients using sunlight-range illumination. This is of significance because (1) 1O2 is known to be cytotoxic, and (2) there have been several reports of toxic effects associated with the use of some sunscreens; most notably, with p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Illuminated aqueous solutions of PABA, 2-ethylhexyl p-(dimethylamino)benzate (ODPABA), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BZ3), 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BZ8), 2-ethylhexyl 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate (OCR), 2-ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate (OMC), and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate (OCS) were evaluated individually for 1O2 formation. Furfuryl alcohol (FFA), a well-known chemical trap for 1O2, was added to each of the aqueous sunscreen solutions. The FFA was consumed when solutions of PABA, ODPABA, OMC, and OCR were illuminated, but no loss of FFA other than by direct photolysis occurred in solutions of BZ3, BZ8, or OCS. There was also no significant loss of FFA in any of these solutions kept in the dark. Further evidence for the formation of 1O2 in illuminated aqueous sunscreen solutions is provided by the results of experiments in which individual solutions containing sunscreen active ingredients and FFA that were diluted with D2O exhibited an increased rate of FFA consumption while the addition of azide ion (N3-) reduced the rate of FFA consumption. Continuous sunlight-range illumination of aqueous PABA solutions produced significantly higher steady-state concentrations of 1O2 than in solutions containing any of the other sunscreen active ingredients evaluated. The substituted benzophenone compounds (BZ3 and BZ8) and the salicylate-based compound (OCS) not only appear to produce no 1O2, but they also appear to produce no other reactive oxidant species that are capable of consuming FFA. This indicates that BZ3, BZ8, and OCS may be peferable, from the standpoint of toxic oxidant formation, for use as sunscreen active ingredients when compared to the other compounds evaluated in this study.},

abstract = {The acclimatization capacity of corals is a critical consideration in the persistence of coral reefs under stresses imposed by global climate change. The stress history of corals plays a role in subsequent response to heat stress, but the transcriptomic changes associated with these plastic changes have not been previously explored. In order to identify host transcriptomic changes associated with acquired thermal tolerance in the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora, corals preconditioned to a sub-lethal temperature of 3{\textdegree}C below bleaching threshold temperature were compared to both non-preconditioned corals and untreated controls using a cDNA microarray platform. After eight days of hyperthermal challenge, conditions under which non-preconditioned corals bleached and preconditioned corals (thermal-tolerant) maintained Symbiodinium density, a clear differentiation in the transcriptional profiles was revealed among the condition examined. Among these changes, nine differentially expressed genes separated preconditioned corals from non-preconditioned corals, with 42 genes differentially expressed between control and preconditioned treatments, and 70 genes between non-preconditioned corals and controls. Differentially expressed genes included components of an apoptotic signaling cascade, which suggest the inhibition of apoptosis in preconditioned corals. Additionally, lectins and genes involved in response to oxidative stress were also detected. One dominant pattern was the apparent tuning of gene expression observed between preconditioned and non-preconditioned treatments; that is, differences in expression magnitude were more apparent than differences in the identity of genes differentially expressed. Our work revealed a transcriptomic signature underlying the tolerance associated with coral thermal history, and suggests that understanding the molecular mechanisms behind physiological acclimatization would be critical for the modeling of reefs in impending climate change scenarios.},

abstract = {Na+- K+-ATPase is arguably the most important enzyme in the animal cell plasma membrane, but the role of the membrane in its regulation is poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between Na+-K+-ATPase and membrane microdomains or "lipid rafts" enriched in sulfatide ( sulfogalactosylceramide/SGC), a glycosphingolipid implicated as a cofactor for this enzyme, in the basolateral membrane of rainbow trout gill epithelium. Our studies demonstrated that when trout adapt to seawater (33 ppt), Na+- K+-ATPase relocates to these structures. Arylsulfatase-induced desulfation of basolateral membrane SGC prevented this relocation and significantly reduced Na+- K+-ATPase activity in seawater but not freshwater trout. We contend that Na+- K+-ATPase partitions into SGC-enriched rafts to help facilitate the up-regulation of its activity during seawater adaptation. We also suggest that differential partitioning of Na+- K+-ATPase between these novel SGC-enriched regulatory platforms results in two distinct, physiological Na+ transport modes. In addition, we extend the working definition of cholesterol-dependent raft integrity to structural dependence on the sulfate moiety of SGC in this membrane.},

abstract = {The photo-physiological characteristics of thermo-tolerant Symbiodinium types have been postulated to have negative effects on the energetics of the reef corals by reducing fitness. To investigate this, two key and inextricably coupled indicators of fitness, lipids and reproduction, were monitored in colonies of the broadcast-spawning coral Acropora millepora over a two-year period that included a natural bleaching event. In the absence of bleaching ITS1-type clade D predominant colonies had 26{\&}{\#}37; lower stored lipids compared to C2 colonies. At spawning time, this correlated with 28{\&}{\#}37; smaller eggs in type-D colonies. This energetic disparity is expected to have reduced larval duration and settlement-competency periods in type-D compared to type-C2 colonies. More importantly, irrespective of the effect of genotype, the fitness of all corals was adversely affected by the stress of the bleaching event which reduced prespawning lipids by 60{\&}{\#}37; and halved the number of eggs compared to the previous year. Our results extend work that has shown that direct temperature stress and symbiont change are likely to work in concert on corals by demonstrating that the lipids and reproduction of the reef building corals on tropical reefs are likely to be impaired by these processes as our climate warms.},

abstract = {The standard model of the dynamic energy budget theory for metabolic organisation has variables and parameters that can be quantified using indirect methods only. We present new methods (and software) to extract food-independent parameter values of the energy budget from food-dependent quantities that are easy to observe, and so facilitate the practical application of the theory to enhance predictability and extrapolation. A natural sequence of 10 steps is discussed to obtain some compound parameters first, then the primary parameters, then the composition parameters and finally the thermodynamic parameters; this sequence matches a sequence of required data of increasing complexity which is discussed in detail. Many applications do not require knowledge of all parameters, and we discuss methods to extrapolate parameters from one species to another. The conversion of mass, volume and energy measures of biomass is discussed; these conversions are not trivial because biomass can change in chemical composition in particular ways thanks to different forms of homeostasis. We solve problems like "What would be the ultimate reproduction rate and the von Bertalanffy growth rate at a specific food level, given that we have measured these statistics at abundant food?" and "What would be the maximum incubation time, given the parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve?". We propose a new non-destructive method for quantifying the chemical potential and entropy of living reserve and structure, that can potentially change our ideas on the thermodynamic properties of life. We illustrate the methods using data on daphnids and molluscs.},

abstract = {In the Red Sea, the zooxanthellate sponge Cliona vastifica (Hancock) is mainly present at >15 m depth or in shaded areas. To test whether its scarcity in unshaded areas of shallower waters is linked to the functional inefficiency of its photosymbionts at high irradiances, sponges were transferred from 30 m to a six times higher light regime at 12 m depth, and then returned to their original location. During this time, photosynthetic responses to irradiance were measured as rapid light curves (RLCs) in situ by pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry using a portable underwater device, and samples were taken for microscopic determinations of zooxanthellar abundance. The zooxanthellae harboured by this sponge adapted to the higher irradiance at 12 m by increasing both their light saturation points and relative photosynthetic electron transport rates (ETRs). The ETRs at light saturation increased almost fourfold within 15-20 days of transfer to the shallower water, and decreased back to almost their original values after the sponges were returned to 30 m depth. This, as well as the fact that the photosynthetic light responses within an individual sponge were in accordance with the irradiance incident to specific surfaces, shows that these photosymbionts are highly adaptable to various irradiances. There was no significant change in the number of zooxanthellae per sponge area throughout these experiments, and the different photosynthetic responses were likely due to adaptations of the photosynthetic apparatus within each zooxanthella. In conclusion, it seems that parameters other than the hypothesised inability of the photosymbionts to adapt adequately to high light conditions are the cause of C. vastifica's rareness in unshaded shallow areas of the Red Sea.},

abstract = {Organisms living in shallow-water tropical coral reef environments are exposed to high UVR irradiances due to the low solar zenith angles (the angle of the sun from the vertical), the natural thinness of the ozone layer over tropical latitudes, and the high transparency of the water column. The hypothesis that solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 290-400 nm) is an important factor that affects the biology and ecology of coral reef organisms dates only to about 1980. It has been previously suggested that increased levels of biologically effective ultraviolet B radiation (UVB, 290-320 nm), which is the waveband primarily affected by ozone depletion, would have relatively small effects on corals and coral reefs and that these effects might be observed as changes in the minimum depths of occurrence of important reef taxa such as corals. This conclusion was based on predictions of increases in UVR as well as its attenuation with depth using the available data on UVR irradiances, ozone levels, and optical properties of the water overlying coral reefs. Here, we review the experimental evidence demonstrating the direct and indirect effects of UVR, both UVB and ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400 nm) on corals and other reef associated biota, with emphasis on those studies conducted since 1996. Additionally, we re-examine the predictions made in 1996 for the increase in UVB on reefs with currently available data, assess whether those predictions were reasonable, and look at what changes might occur on coral reefs in the future as the multiple effects (i.e. increased temperature, hypercapnia, and ocean acidification) of global climate change continue.},

abstract = {Holobionts are assemblages of microbial symbionts and their macrobial host. As extant representatives of some of the oldest macro-organisms, corals and algae are important for understanding how holobionts develop and interact with one another. Using untargeted metabolomics, we show that non-self interactions altered the coral metabolome more than self-interactions (i.e. different or same genus, respectively). Platelet activating factor (PAF) and Lyso-PAF, central inflammatory modulators in mammals, were major lipid components of the coral holobionts. When corals were damaged during competitive interactions with algae, PAF increased along with expression of the gene encoding Lyso-PAF acetyltransferase; the protein responsible for converting Lyso-PAF to PAF. This shows that self and non-self recognition among some of the oldest extant holobionts involve bioactive lipids identical to those in highly derived taxa like humans. This further strengthens the hypothesis that major players of the immune response evolved during the pre-Cambrian.},

abstract = {All reef-building corals are obligately associated with photosynthetic microalgal endosymbionts called zooxanthellae. Zooxanthella taxonomy has emphasized differences between species of hosts, but the possibility of ecologically significant zooxanthella diversity within hosts has been the subject of speculation for decades. Analysis of two dominant Caribbean corals showed that each associates with three taxa of zooxanthellae that exhibit zonation with depth-the primary environmental gradient for light-dependent marine organisms. Some colonies apparently host two taxa of symbionts in proportions that can vary across the colony. This common occurrence of polymorphic, habitat-specific symbioses challenges conventional understanding of the units of biodiversity but also illuminates many distinctive aspects of marine animal-algal associations. Habitat specificity provides ecological explanations for the previously documented poor concordance between host and symbiont phylogenies and the otherwise surprising lack of direct, maternal transmission of symbionts in many species of hosts. Polymorphic symbioses may underlie the conspicuous and enigmatic variability characteristic of responses to environmental stress (e.g., coral ''bleaching'') and contribute importantly to the phenomenon of photoadaptation.},

In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 $\mu$mol photons m(-2) s(-1) under ambient (493 $\mu$atm) and high PCO2 (878 $\mu$atm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of PCO2 with light, and at 493 $\mu$atm PCO2 the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 $\mu$atm PCO2, the effect of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 $\mu$atm PCO2, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 $\mu$atm and 878 $\mu$atm PCO2 at intermediate light intensities (ca. 70 $\mu$mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and PCO2, and was highest at 122 $\mu$mol photons m(-2) s(-1) in both PCO2 treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high PCO2 decreased calcification of P. damicornis recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the effect of PCO2 on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory effects of high PCO2 on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.},

abstract = {Several untested aspects of the regulation of inorganic nutrient uptake were examined using nutrient depletion experiments with the symbiotic coral Stylophora pistillata . The total inhibition of phosphate uptake in artificial seawater lacking sodium indicates the involvement of a sodium/phosphate symporter for the uptake of phosphate across host membranes. Addition of ammonium or nitrate (up to 6.0 $\mu$mol l{\textendash}1) did not enhance saturated phosphate uptake rates, thus indicating that corals, or their symbiotic algae, were not, or not sufficiently, nitrogen limited to modify their phosphate needs. Conversely, the saturated uptake rate of ammonium increased by 2.5-fold in the presence of 3.0 $\mu$mol l{\textendash}1 of phosphate, thus indicating that the corals or their symbionts were lacking intracellular phosphate to take advantage of the inorganic nitrogen compounds dissolved in their surrounding medium. Overall, these results highlight some greater limitation in phosphate rather than in nitrogen. Finally, the rate of phosphate uptake decreased with particulate feeding of the host (organic phosphate source). Indeed, corals that were fed 1 and 3 days before the uptake experiment took up phosphate 42 and 19% slower, respectively, than corals that were fed 21 days before. This result provides additional evidence of phosphate limitation in S. pistillata . This study therefore brings new insights into the relationships between nutrients and symbiotic corals, and may provide a rapid and effective tool to investigate which nutrient is the most limiting for coral metabolism.},

abstract = {Compounded disturbances are becoming increasingly common on coral reefs. Impacts of global warming, which is generally perceived as the most serious threat to coral reefs today, often coincide with various common anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution and overharvesting. To better evaluate the impact of global warming, interactions between elevated temperature and background disturbance should be investigated. In this study, the physiological response of the reef-building coral Porites cylindrica was investigated, when exposed to enrichment of dissolved inorganic nitrate (+ 15 muM for 14 days) and elevated seawater temperature ( + 2 C for 48 h), in the absence of particulate food. It was shown that P. cvlindrica was able to tolerate the temperature exposure without losing symbiotic microalgae or chlorophyll pigments, although the photosynthetic capacity was affected. Nitrate enrichment significantly reduced primary production rate, although zooxanthella population density and chlorophyll concentrations were not affected. The combination of elevated temperature and nitrate enrichment produced an even more pronounced reduction of the production rate. Since coral respiration rate remained unaffected by the treatments, this implies that the corals were unable to acclimate to impaired photosynthesis. However, there was no indication of subsequently reduced tissue growth or increased host catabolism based on tissue biomass measurements. On the other hand, all corals, including controls, lost tissue biomass during the exposure, suggesting a dependence on particulate food. Our results imply that corals on nutrient-exposed reefs may be more stressed during periods of elevated temperature, compared to corals in more pristine areas.},

abstract = {While a number of factors have been linked to coral bleaching, such as high light, high temperature, low salinity, and UV exposure, the best explanation for recent coral bleaching events are small temperature excursions of 1 to 2 degreesC above summer sea-surface temperatures in the tropics which induce the dinoflagellate. symbionts (zooxanthellae) to be expelled from the host. The mechanism that triggers this expulsion of the algal symbionts is not resolved, but has been attributed to damage to the photosynthetic mechanism of the zooxanthellae. In the present investigation we addressed the question of whether such expelled zooxanthellae are indeed impaired irreversibly in their photosynthesis. We employed a Microscopy Pulse Amplitude-Modulated (PAM) fluorometer, by which individual zooxanthellae can be examined to study photosynthesis in zooxanthellae expelled when corals are subjected to a temperature of 33 degreesC. We show that the expelled zooxanthellae from Cyphastrea serailia were largely unaffected in their photosynthesis and could be heated to 37 degreesC before showing temperature-induced photosynthetic impairment. These results suggest strongly that the early events that trigger temperature-induced expulsion of zooxanthellae involve a dysfunction in the interaction of the zooxanthellae and the coral host tissue, and not a dysfunction in the zooxanthellae per se.},

All modern foraminiferal species involved in such symbiosis are included in our analyses. The pelagic symbiotic dinoflagellates form a monophyletic group sister to the Symbiodinium species complex found in coastal-benthic environments. The pelagic symbionts are descendants of free-living species and, together with the coastal-benthic Symbiodinium spp., they originated from the early Mesozoic suessiacean family represented by the extant Polarella glacialis. Out of hundreds of single planktonic foraminifera examined, 21 unique pelagic symbiont ribotypes were recognized, which could be divided into 2 main clades and 4 genetic subgroups, We observed an absence of specificity between the symbiont genetic types and the host genetic and morphological species. A few foraminifera even harbored dinoflagellates of more than one genetic subgroup. This genetic flexibility may be constrained by the fast life cycles of pelagic single-cell hosts, which acquire symbionts de novo from the ambient water at each generation. The obligatory transitional free-living stage of pelagic symbionts prior to acquisition by foraminiferal hosts may also explain their significantly lower rates of DNA substitution in comparison to their coastal-benthic relatives. We propose that the open ocean ecosystem has maintained photosymbioses involving a relatively low genetic diversity, but an extreme flexibility in the relationships between both partners, which also preserved their ancestral ability for independent life.},

abstract = {During the past several decades, numerous reports from disparate geographical areas have documented an increased frequency of "bleaching" in reef-forming corals. The phenomenon, triggered by increased sea surface temperatures, occurs when the cnidarian hosts digest and/or expel their intracellular, photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts ("zooxanthellae" in the genus Symbiodinium). Although coral bleaching is often followed by the death of the animal hosts, in some cases, the animal survives and can be repopulated with viable zooxanthellae. The physiological factors determining the ability of the coral to survive bleaching events are poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally established that bleaching and death of the host animal involve a caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade induced by reactive oxygen species produced primarily by the algal symbionts. In addition, we demonstrate that, although some corals naturally suppress caspase activity and significantly reduce caspase concentration under high temperatures as a mechanism to prevent colony death from apoptosis, even sensitive corals can be prevented from dying by application of exogenous inhibitors of caspases. Our results indicate that variability in response to thermal stress in corals is determined by a four-element, combinatorial genetic matrix intrinsic to the specific symbiotic association. Based on our experimental data, we present a working model in which the phenotypic expression of this symbiont/host relationship places a selective pressure on the symbiotic association. The model predicts the survival of the host animals in which the caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade is down-regulated.},

abstract = {Background The Symbiodinium community associated with scleractinian corals is widely considered to be shaped by seawater temperature, as the coral's upper temperature tolerance is largely contingent on the Symbiodinium types harboured. Few studies have challenged this paradigm as knowledge of other environmental drivers on the distribution of Symbiodinium is limited. Here, we examine the influence of a range of environmental variables on the distribution of Symbiodinium associated with Acropora millepora collected from 47 coral reefs spanning 1,400 km on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Methodology/Principal Findings The environmental data included Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data at 1 km spatial resolution from which a number of sea surface temperature (SST) and water quality metrics were derived. In addition, the carbonate and mud composition of sediments were incorporated into the analysis along with in situ water quality samples for a subset of locations. Analyses were conducted at three spatio-temporal scales [GBR (regional-scale), Whitsunday Islands (local-scale) and Keppel Islands/Trunk Reef (temporal)] to examine the effects of scale on the distribution patterns. While SST metrics were important drivers of the distribution of Symbiodinium types at regional and temporal scales, our results demonstrate that spatial variability in water quality correlates significantly with Symbiodinium distribution at local scales. Background levels of Symbiodinium types were greatest at turbid inshore locations of the Whitsunday Islands where SST predictors were not as important. This was not the case at regional scales where combinations of mud and carbonate sediment content coupled with SST anomalies and mean summer SST explained 51.3% of the variation in dominant Symbiodinium communities. Conclusions/Significance Reef corals may respond to global-scale stressors such as climate change through changes in their resident symbiont communities, however, management of local-scale stressors such as altered water quality is also necessary for maintenance of coral- Symbiodinium associations.},

abstract = {Most known starfish species possess a compound eye at the tip of each arm, which, except for the lack of true optics, resembles an arthropod compound eye. Although these compound eyes have been known for about two centuries, no visually guided behaviour has ever been directly associated with their presence. There are indications that they are involved in negative phototaxis but this may also be governed by extraocular photoreceptors. Here, we show that the eyes of the coral-reef-associated starfish Linckia laevigata are slow and colour blind. The eyes are capable of true image formation although with low spatial resolution. Further, our behavioural experiments reveal that only specimens with intact eyes can navigate back to their reef habitat when displaced, demonstrating that this is a visually guided behaviour. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a function of starfish compound eyes. We also show that the spectral sensitivity optimizes the contrast between the reef and the open ocean. Our results provide an example of an eye supporting only low-resolution vision, which is believed to be an essential stage in eye evolution, preceding the high-resolution vision required for detecting prey, predators and conspecifics.},

Moreover, rates of genetic adaptation and/or changes in the coral{\textendash}zooxanthella partnerships are considered unlikely to be sufficiently fast for corals to acquire increased physiological resistance to increasing sea temperatures and declining pH. However, it has been suggested that coral reef resilience to climate change may be improved by good local management of coral reefs, including management of water quality. Here, using major data sets from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, we investigate geographic patterns of coral bleaching in 1998 and 2002 and outline a synergism between heat stress and nutrient flux as a major causative mechanism for those patterns. The study provides the first concrete evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of coral reefs to global climate change.},

Although the consequences to ecosystems and communities of metazoans are only beginning to be revealed, a key to forecasting expected changes in animal communities is an understanding of species' vulnerability to a changing environment. For example, environmental stressors may affect a particular species by driving that organism outside a tolerance window, by altering the costs of metabolic processes under the new conditions, or by changing patterns of development and reproduction. Implicit in all these examples is the foundational understanding of physiological mechanisms and how a particular environmental driver (e.g., temperature and ocean acidification) will be transduced through the animal to alter tolerances and performance. In this review, we highlight examples of mechanisms, focusing on those underlying physiological plasticity, that operate in contemporary organisms as a means to consider physiological responses that are available to organisms in the future.},

These episodes have usually been attributed to increases in seawater temperatures3-10, but the mass bleaching events that occurred throughout the Caribbean during 1987 and 1990 were not readily explained by temperature alone11,12. An additional factor that may have contributed to these bleaching episodes is ultraviolet radiation in the 280-400-nm band. At many localities where bleaching occurred in 1987 and 1990, sea conditions were described as extremely calm with exceptionally clear water13. In the absence of suspended organic and inorganic matter in the water column, higher than average intensities of ultraviolet radiation probably reached all depths within the photic zone for several consecutive months. Evidence for a possible link between ultraviolet radiation and coral bleaching has not been forthcoming2. Here we report results of a field experiment showing that, irrespective of high water temperatures, short-term (three weeks) increases in ultraviolet radiation of a magnitude possible under calm, clear water column conditions can readily induce bleaching in reef-building corals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corals worldwide are in decline due to climate change effects (e.g., rising seawater temperatures), pollution, and exploitation. The ability of corals to cope with these stressors in the long run depends on the evolvability of the underlying genetic networks and proteins, which remain largely unknown. A genome-wide scan for positively selected genes between related coral species can help to narrow down the search space considerably. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We screened a set of 2,604 putative orthologs from EST-based sequence datasets of the coral species Acropora millepora and Acropora palmata to determine the fraction and identity of proteins that may experience adaptive evolution. 7% of the orthologs show elevated rates of evolution. Taxonomically-restricted (i.e. lineage-specific) genes show a positive selection signature more frequently than genes that are found across many animal phyla. The class of proteins that displayed elevated evolutionary rates was significantly enriched for proteins involved in immunity and defense, reproduction, and sensory perception. We also found elevated rates of evolution in several other functional groups such as management of membrane vesicles, transmembrane transport of ions and organic molecules, cell adhesion, and oxidative stress response. Proteins in these processes might be related to the endosymbiotic relationship corals maintain with dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. CONCLUSION/RELEVANCE: This study provides a birds-eye view of the processes potentially underlying coral adaptation, which will serve as a foundation for future work to elucidate the rates, patterns, and mechanisms of corals' evolutionary response to global climate change.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching events are often associated with higher levels of coral mortality but when this occurs in the chronology of individual bleaching events is poorly documented. Knowing when mortality occurs is important for understanding molecular mechanisms and the putative adaptive significance of the response (the Adaptive Bleaching Hypothesis). In a detailed study of a coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef, involving weekly and twice weekly repetitive observations of > 200 individually marked corals over an 18 month period (similar to 16,000 observations), it is shown that bleaching in Acropora latistella, A. subulata and Turbinaria mesenterina was an acute, rapid response, occurring within days of a peak in seawater temperatures exceeding previously described thresholds. Subsurface light levels, measured over the duration of the event, were not anomalous. Full bleaching (i.e. whole colonies turning bone-white) and partial bleaching (white patches) was observed in the Acropora spp. whilst the T. mesenterina colonies typically paled to a light brown colour. Algal densities in bleached corals were 10-30% of those of normally pigmented corals (similar to 2.5 x 10(6) algae per cm(2)), and in this instance bleaching was clearly a sudden, isolated, stress event and not an extreme low-point in the seasonal fluctuation of the density of symbiotic algae. Bleached corals were associated with high levels of partial and whole-colony mortality, but mortality was exclusively limited to the two Acropora spp. Importantly, most of this mortality was recorded in surveys conducted 1 and 2 weeks after bleaching was first observed, and for A. latistella as little as 1 week after bleaching was first observed. This suggests that in this particular bleaching event, for the Acropora species, that bleaching and mortality were intimately linked: this in turn suggests it was a pathological phenomenon. The study highlights a problem in the adaptive bleaching hypothesis, whereby significant levels of mortality can occur in a bleaching event before any chance for subsequent recombination of the host-symbiont unit. It is argued that in order to further evaluate the significance of bleaching as a potentially adaptive mechanism, bleaching-induced and bleaching-related mortality have to be fully considered. It is necessary to incorporate the cost (in terms of mortality) of a bleaching event, the recurring cost of reverting to the original, mortal, stress-prone combination after the event, and the higher cost associated with forming a maladaptive combination.},

abstract = {The symbiotic associations between cnidarians and dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium) support productive and diverse ecosystems in coral reefs. Many aspects of this association, including the mechanistic basis of host-symbiont recognition and metabolic interaction, remain poorly understood. The first completed genome sequence for a symbiotic anthozoan is now available (the coral Acropora digitifera), and extensive expressed sequence tag resources are available for a variety of other symbiotic corals and anemones. These resources make it possible to profile gene expression, protein abundance, and protein localization associated with the symbiotic state. Here we review the history of "omics" studies of cnidarian-algal symbiosis and the current availability of sequence resources for corals and anemones, identifying genes putatively involved in symbiosis across 10 anthozoan species. The public availability of candidate symbiosis-associated genes leaves the field of cnidarian-algal symbiosis poised for in-depth comparative studies of sequence diversity and gene expression and for targeted functional studies of genes associated with symbiosis. Reviewing the progress to date suggests directions for future investigations of cnidarian-algal symbiosis that include (i) sequencing of Symbiodinium, (ii) proteomic analysis of the symbiosome membrane complex, (iii) glycomic analysis of Symbiodinium cell surfaces, and (iv) expression profiling of the gastrodermal cells hosting Symbiodinium.},

abstract = {Zooxanthella symbioses are arguably the most important ecological interaction on coral reefs because they energetically subsidize the entire community, and enhance the calcification process that provides structure for all other organisms. While we have developed a detailed understanding of the diversity among and within the Symbiodinium clades, we currently lack a mechanistic explanation for which factors favoured zooxanthella invasion of the intracellular habitat in heterotrophic hosts, and for what molecular mechanisms permit residence within the cell. We propose two hypotheses that explain important evolutionary and ecological features of zooxanthella symbioses. The magnesium inhibition hypothesis (MIH) states that increases in the Mg/Ca ratio in sea water that occurred over the last 100 million years created a situation where Mg(2+) inhibited Ca(2+) transport to zooxanthellae. The MIH predicts, among other things, that the intracellular niche was invaded as a response to this abiotic stressor. The arrested phagosome hypothesis (APH) states that Symbiodinium spp. mimic host cell endosomal digestive machinery via the symbiosome to appear like digesting prey through perpetual release of zooxanthella-derived compounds. The APH represents a subtle but important distinction from previous hypotheses regarding interactions between symbiont and host at the cellular level. The APH predicts that symbionts tune rates of material release to match expectations of host cellular machinery. An outcome of the APH is that intra-host residence time becomes a vital parameter to consider. Both hypotheses shift control of the symbiosis away from the host, and instead focus attention on the niche requirements of Symbiodinium spp.},

abstract = {16S rRNA sequencing, commonly used to survey microbial communities, begins by grouping individual reads into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). There are two major challenges in calling OTUs: identifying bacterial population boundaries and differentiating true diversity from sequencing errors. Current approaches to identifying taxonomic groups or eliminating sequencing errors rely on sequence data alone, but both of these activities could be informed by the distribution of sequences across samples. Here, we show that using the distribution of sequences across samples can help identify population boundaries even in noisy sequence data. The logic underlying our approach is that bacteria in different populations will often be highly correlated in their abundance across different samples. Conversely, 16S rRNA sequences derived from the same population, whether slightly different copies in the same organism, variation of the 16S rRNA gene within a population, or sequences generated randomly in error, will have the same underlying distribution across sampled environments. We present a simple OTU-calling algorithm (distribution-based clustering) that uses both genetic distance and the distribution of sequences across samples and demonstrate that it is more accurate than other methods at grouping reads into OTUs in a mock community. Distribution-based clustering also performs well on environmental samples: it is sensitive enough to differentiate between OTUs that differ by a single base pair yet predicts fewer overall OTUs than most other methods. The program can decrease the total number of OTUs with redundant information and improve the power of many downstream analyses to describe biologically relevant trends.},

While social media is a valuable tool for outreach and the sharing of ideas, there is a danger that this form of communication is gaining too high a value and that we are losing sight of key metrics of scientific value, such as citation indices. To help quantify this, I propose the 'Kardashian Index', a measure of discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record based on the direct comparison of numbers of citations and Twitter followers.},

abstract = {The density and regulation of microbial populations are important factors in the success of symbiotic associations. High bacterial density may improve transmission to the next generation, but excessive replication could turn out to be costly to the host and result in higher virulence. Moreover, differences in virulence may also depend on the diversity of symbionts. Using the maternally transmitted symbiont Wolbachia, we investigated how bacterial density and diversity are regulated and influence virulence in host insects subject to multiple infection. The model we used was the wasp Asobara tabida that naturally harbors three different Wolbachia strains, of which two are facultative and induce cytoplasmic incompatibility, whereas the third is necessary for the host to achieve oogenesis. Using insect lines infected with different subsets of Wolbachia strains, we show that: (i) some traits of A. tabida are negatively affected by Wolbachia; (ii) the physiological cost increases with the number of co-infecting strains, which also corresponds to an increase in the total bacterial density; and (iii) the densities of the two facultative Wolbachia strains are independent of one another, whereas the obligatory strain is less abundant when it is alone, suggesting that there is some positive interaction with the other strains.},

abstract = {The microbiota of the human stomach and the influence of Helicobacter pylori colonization on its composition remain largely unknown. We characterized bacterial diversity within the human gastric mucosa by using a small subunit 16S rDNA clone library approach and analyzed 1,833 sequences generated by broad-range bacterial PCR from 23 gastric endoscopic biopsy samples. A diverse community of 128 phylotypes was identified, featuring diversity at this site greater than previously described. The majority of sequences were assigned to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria phyla. Ten percent of the phylotypes were previously uncharacterized, including a Deinococcus-related organism, relatives of which have been found in extreme environments but not reported before in humans. The gastric clone libraries from 19 subjects contained H. pylori rDNA; however, only 12 of these subjects tested positive for H. pylori by conventional laboratory methods. Statistical analysis revealed a large degree of intersubject variability of the gastric ecosystem. The presence of H. pylori did not affect the composition of the gastric community. This gastric bacterial rDNA data set was significantly different from sequence collections of the human mouth and esophagus described in other studies, indicating that the human stomach may be home to a distinct microbial eco-system. The gastric microbiota may play important, as-yet-undiscovered roles in human health and disease.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of contamination of the tropical marine environment by Photosystem II (PSII) herbicides used in agriculture and antifouling paints has led to concerns regarding the effects on corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellate algae. In reviewing the ecotoxicological studies conducted so far, PSII herbicides appear able to readily penetrate the coral tissues and rapidly (within minutes) reduce the photochemical efficiency of the intracellular algal symbionts. The dinoflagellates appear at least as sensitive to PSII herbicides as other phototrophs tested so far, with photosynthesis being affected at exceptionally low concentrations (i.e. in the ng/l range). At these levels and over short exposure periods, the effects can be fully reversible (i.e. when corals are returned to clean seawater) and vary according to type of herbicide; however, when exposed to higher concentrations in the light or over longer exposure periods, it results in a long-term sustained reduction of the photochemical efficiency of the algae (symptomatic of chronic photoinhibition). This can result in the dissociation of the symbiosis (bleaching) which is a common but nevertheless significant sublethal stress response requiring many months to recover from. It is argued that the reliance of corals on an endosymbiotic photoautotrophic energy source, together with predilection for the symbiosis to dissociate when photosynthesis of the algae is affected, renders coral particularly susceptible to changes in environmental conditions{\textemdash}and especially phytotoxins such as PSII herbicides.

Causes for its decline have been attributed to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Physical and geochemical data are used to explore conditions under which this species thrived in early to middle Holocene reef deposits (ca. 9.4-5.4 ka) of the Enriquillo Valley, southwestern Dominican Republic. This study shows that A. cervicornis flourished during a 4000 yr period spanning the Holocene Thermal Maximum, and high-resolution radiocarbon dating reveals continuous growth for at least 2000 yr. Holocene A. cervicornis survived large-scale climate and environmental changes that included high temperatures, variable salinity, hurricanes, and rapid sea-level rise with remarkable resilience. Our data suggest that the recent decline in A. cervicornis is anomalous and likely tied to ecosystem change beyond natural causes.},

abstract = {Although complex co-occurrence patterns have been described among microbes in natural communities, these patterns have scarcely been interpreted in the context of ecosystem functioning and stability. Here, we constructed networks from species co-occurrences between pairs of microorganisms, which were extracted from five individual aquatic time-series, including a dystrophic and a eutrophic lake, as well as an open ocean site. The resulting networks exhibited higher clustering coefficient, shorter path lengths, higher average node degree and betweenness when compared to random networks. Moreover, computer simulations demonstrated that taxa with a high number of co-occurrences and placement at convergence positions in the network, so called 'hubs' and 'bottlenecks', confer resistance against random removal of 'taxa'. Accordingly, we refer to co-occurrences at convergence positions as system-relevant interdependencies, as they, like 'hubs' and 'bottlenecks', determine network topology. These topology features of the co-occurrence networks point towards microbial community dynamics being resistant over time and thus could provide indicators for the state of ecosystem stability.},

abstract = {Microorganisms in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are essential to environmental sustainability. In the marine environment, invertebrates often depend on metabolic cooperation with their endosymbionts. Coral reefs, one of the most important marine ecosystems, are based on the symbiosis between a broad diversity of dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium and a wide phyletic diversity of hosts (i.e., cnidarian, molluscan, poriferan). This diversity is reflected in the ecology and physiology of the symbionts, yet the underlying biochemical mechanisms are still poorly understood. We examined metabolite profiles of four cultured species of Symbiodinium known to form viable symbioses with reef-building corals, S. microadriaticum (cp-type A194), S. minutum (cp-type B184), S. psygmophilum (cp-type B224) and S. trenchii (cp-type D206). Metabolite profiles were shown to differ among Symbiodinium species and were found to be affected by their physiological response to growth in different temperatures and light regimes. A combined Random Forests and Bayesian analysis revealed that the four Symbiodinium species examined primarily differed in their production of sterols and sugars, including a C29 stanol and the two sterols C28$\Delta$5 and C28$\Delta$5,22, as well as differences in metabolite abundances of a hexose and inositol. Inositol levels were also strongly affected by changes in temperature across all Symbiodinium species.

abstract = {Endosymbiotic dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Symbiodinium associate with a diverse range of marine invertebrate hosts and also exist free-living in the ocean. The genus is divided into eight lineages (clades A-H), which contain multiple subclade types that show geographic and host specificity. It is commonly known that free-living dinoflagellates can and have been introduced to new geographic locations, primarily through shipping ballast water. In this study we sequenced the ITS2 region of Symbiodinium found in symbiosis with the coral Acropora cytherea in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument and from shipping ballast water. Identification of an unusual symbiont in Acropora cytherea and an analysis of the distribution of this symbiont suggests an introduction to Hawaii vectored by the scyphozoan host, Cassiopea sp. Symbiodinium were also detected in shipping ballast water. This work confirms that marine invertebrate endosymbionts can be introduced to new geographic locations vectored by animal hosts or the ballast water of ships.},

By relating environmental conditions, notably food availability, to individual life histories, DEB theory makes it possible, in principle, to make predictions for individuals and populations that extend beyond the conditions used to develop and parameterize the model. However, for this approach to reach its full potential as a predictive theory, we need methods of similar sophistication to link unobservable modeled quantities to data and to infer model parameters. Here, we develop such a method in a Bayesian framework. We offer a rigorous methodology for modeling the link between underlying unobservable states and observable quantities and for parameter inference. The methodology is introduced and its effectiveness as applied to data simulated under various dynamic food regimes is demonstrated. We also examine how parameter estimates can be ...},

abstract = {Coral reefs are globally threatened by climate change-related ocean warming and ocean acidification (OA). To date, slow-response mechanisms such as genetic adaptation have been considered the major determinant of coral reef persistence, with little consideration of rapid-response acclimatization mechanisms. These rapid mechanisms such as parental effects that can contribute to trans-generational acclimatization (e.g. epigenetics) have, however, been identified as important contributors to offspring response in other systems. We present the first evidence of parental effects in a cross-generational exposure to temperature and OA in reef-building corals. Here, we exposed adults to high (28.9{\textdegree}C, 805 {\textmu}atm PCO2 ) or ambient (26.5{\textdegree}C, 417 {\textmu}atm PCO2 ) temperature and OA treatments during the larval brooding period. Exposure to high treatment negatively affected adult performance, but their larvae exhibited size differences and metabolic acclimation when subsequently re-exposed, unlike larvae from parents exposed to ambient conditions. Understanding the innate capacity corals possess to respond to current and future climatic conditions is essential to reef protection and maintenance. Our results identify that parental effects may have an important role through (1) ameliorating the effects of stress through preconditioning and adaptive plasticity, and/or (2) amplifying the negative parental response through latent effects on future life stages. Whether the consequences of parental effects and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization are beneficial or maladaptive, our work identifies a critical need to expand currently proposed climate change outcomes for corals to further assess rapid response mechanisms that include non-genetic inheritance through parental contributions and classical epigenetic mechanisms.},

abstract = {The spectral light field of Symbiodinium within the tissue of the coral animal host can deviate strongly from the ambient light field on a coral reef and that of artificial light sources used in lab studies on coral photobiology. Here, we used a novel approach involving light microsensor measurements and a programmable light engine to reconstruct the spectral light field that Symbiodinium is exposed to inside the coral host and the light field of a conventional halogen lamp in a comparative study of Symbiodinium photobiology. We found that extracellular gross photosynthetic O 2 evolution was unchanged under different spectral illumination, while the more red-weighted halogen lamp spectrum decreased PSII electron transport rates and there was a trend towards increased light-enhanced dark respiration rates under excess irradiance. The approach provided here allows for reconstructing and comparing intra-tissue coral light fields and other complex spectral compositions of incident irradiance. This novel combination of sensor technologies provides a framework to studying the influence of macro- and microscale optics on Symbiodinium photobiology with unprecedented spectral resolution.},

abstract = {During experimental Light-dark cycles, O-2 in the tissue of the colonial scleractinian corals Favia sp. and Acropora sp. reached >250% of air saturation after a few minutes in Light. Immediately after darkening, O-2 was depleted rapidly, and within 5 min the O-2 concentration at the tissue surface reached <2% of air saturation. The pH of the tissue changed within 10 min from about 8.5 in the light to 7.3 in the dark. Oxygen and pH profiles revealed a diffusive boundary layer of flow-dependent thickness, which limited coral respiration in the dark. The Light field at the tissue surface (measured as scalar irradiance, E(0)) differed strongly with respect to light intensity and spectral composition from the incident collimated light (measured as downwelling irradiance, E(d)) Scalar irradiance reached up to 180% of E(d) at the coral tissue surface for wavelengths subject to less absorption by the coral tissue (600 to 650 nm and (680 nm). The scalar irradiance spectra exhibited bands of chlorophyll a (chi a) (675 nm), chi c (630 to 640 nm) and peridinin (540 nm) absorption and a broad absorption band due to chlorophylls and carotenoids between 400 and 550 nm. The shape of both action spectra and photosynthesis vs irradiance (P vs I) curves depended on the choice of the light intensity parameter. Calculations of initial slopes and onset of Light saturation, I-k, showed that P vs E(0) curves exhibit a lower initial slope and a higher I-k than corresponding P vs E(d) curves. Coral respiration in light was calculated as the difference between the measured gross and net photosynthesis, and was found to be >6 times higher at a saturating irradiance of 350 mu Ein m(-2) s(-1) than the dark respiration measured under identical hydrodynamic conditions (flow rate of 5 to 6 cm s(-1)).},

abstract = {Nutrient loading is one of the strongest drivers of marine habitat degradation. Yet, the link between nutrients and disease epizootics in marine organisms is often tenuous and supported only by correlative data. Here, we present experimental evidence that chronic nutrient exposure leads to increases in both disease prevalence and severity and coral bleaching in scleractinian corals, the major habitat-forming organisms in tropical reefs. Over 3 years, from June 2009 to June 2012, we continuously exposed areas of a coral reef to elevated levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. At the termination of the enrichment, we surveyed over 1200 scleractinian corals for signs of disease or bleaching. Siderastrea siderea corals within enrichment plots had a twofold increase in both the prevalence and severity of disease compared with corals in unenriched control plots. In addition, elevated nutrient loading increased coral bleaching; Agaricia spp. of corals exposed to nutrients suffered a 3.5-fold increase in bleaching frequency relative to control corals, providing empirical support for a hypothesized link between nutrient loading and bleaching-induced coral declines. However, 1~year later, after nutrient enrichment had been terminated for 10~months, there were no differences in coral disease or coral bleaching prevalence between the previously enriched and control treatments. Given that our experimental enrichments were well within the ranges of ambient nutrient concentrations found on many degraded reefs worldwide, these data provide strong empirical support to the idea that coastal nutrient loading is one of the major factors contributing to the increasing levels of both coral disease and coral bleaching. Yet, these data also suggest that simple improvements to water quality may be an effective way to mitigate some coral disease epizootics and the corresponding loss of coral cover in the future.},

perhaps "less strict" corals, which may be less disease resistant due to a lesser degree of elimination of pathogens, may bleach less because they may also be "less strict" in hosting compromised symbionts?

abstract = {Disease epidemics have caused extensive damage to tropical coral reefs and to the reef-building corals themselves, yet nothing is known about the abilities of the coral host to resist disease infection. Understanding the potential for natural disease resistance in corals is critically important, especially in the Caribbean where the two ecologically dominant shallow-water corals, Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata, have suffered an unprecedented mass die-off due to White Band Disease (WBD), and are now listed as threatened under the US Threatened Species Act and as critically endangered under the IUCN Red List criteria. Here we examine the potential for natural resistance to WBD in the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis by combining microsatellite genotype information with in situ transmission assays and field monitoring of WBD on tagged genotypes. We show that six percent of staghorn coral genotypes (3 out of 49) are resistant to WBD. This natural resistance to WBD in staghorn corals represents the first evidence of host disease resistance in scleractinian corals and demonstrates that staghorn corals have an innate ability to resist WBD infection. These resistant staghorn coral genotypes may explain why pockets of Acropora have been able to survive the WBD epidemic. Understanding disease resistance in these corals may be the critical link to restoring populations of these once dominant corals throughout their range.

abstract = {Coral bleaching occurs when there is a breakdown of the symbiosis between cnidarian hosts and resident Symbiodinium spp. Multiple mechanisms for the bleaching process have been identified, including apoptosis and autophagy, and most previous work has focused on the Symbiodinium cell as the initiator of the bleaching cascade. In this work we show that it is possible for host cells to initiate apoptosis that can contribute to death of the Symbiodinium cell. First we found that colchicine, which results in apoptosis in other animals, causes cell death in the model anemone Aiptasia sp. but not in cultured Symbiodinium CCMP-830 cells or in cells freshly isolated from host Aiptasia (at least within the time frame of our study). In contrast, when symbiotic Aiptasia were incubated in colchicine, cell death in the resident Symbiodinium cells was observed, suggesting a host effect on symbiont mortality. Using live-cell confocal imaging of macerated symbiotic host cell isolates, we identified a pattern where the initiation of host cell death was followed by mortality of the resident Symbiodinium cells. This same pattern was observed in symbiotic host cells that were subjected to temperature stress. This research suggests that mortality of symbionts during temperature-induced bleaching can be initiated in part by host cell apoptosis.},

At the same time, deep sequencing can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity through the generation of low-frequency, error-prone reads. Even with sequencing error rates below 0.005 per nucleotide position, the common method of generating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by multiple sequence alignment and complete-linkage clustering significantly increases the number of predicted OTUs and inflates richness estimates. We show that a 2% single-linkage preclustering methodology followed by an average-linkage clustering based on pairwise alignments more accurately predicts expected OTUs in both single and pooled template preparations of known taxonomic composition. This new clustering method can reduce the OTU richness in environmental samples by as much as 30-60% but does not reduce the fraction of OTUs in long-tailed rank abundance curves that defines the rare biosphere.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Coral reefs are hotspots of biodiversity, yet processes of diversification in these ecosystems are poorly understood. The environmental heterogeneity of coral reef environments could be an important contributor to diversification, however, evidence supporting ecological speciation in corals is sparse. Here, we present data from a widespread coral species that reveals a strong association of host and symbiont lineages with specific habitats, consistent with distinct, sympatric gene pools that are maintained through ecologically-based selection.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Populations of a common brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, were sampled from three adjacent reef habitats (spanning a approximately 30 m depth range) at three locations on the Great Barrier Reef (n = 336). The populations were assessed for genetic structure using a combination of mitochondrial (putative control region) and nuclear (three microsatellites) markers for the coral host, and the ITS2 region of the ribosomal DNA for the algal symbionts (Symbiodinium). Our results show concordant genetic partitioning of both the coral host and its symbionts across the different habitats, independent of sampling location.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:This study demonstrates that coral populations and their associated symbionts can be highly structured across habitats on a single reef. Coral populations from adjacent habitats were found to be genetically isolated from each other, whereas genetic similarity was maintained across similar habitat types at different locations. The most parsimonious explanation for the observed genetic partitioning across habitats is that adaptation to the local environment has caused ecological divergence of distinct genetic groups within S. hystrix.},

abstract = {The causes of dolphin and whale stranding can often be difficult to determine. Because toothed whales rely on echolocation for orientation and feeding, hearing deficits could lead to stranding. We report on the results of auditory evoked potential measurements from eight species of odontocete cetaceans that were found stranded or severely entangled in fishing gear during the period 2004 through 2009. Approximately 57% of the bottlenose dolphins and 36% of the rough-toothed dolphins had significant hearing deficits with a reduction in sensitivity equivalent to severe (70{\textendash}90 dB) or profound ({\&}gt;90 dB) hearing loss in humans. The only stranded short-finned pilot whale examined had profound hearing loss. No impairments were detected in seven Risso's dolphins from three different stranding events, two pygmy killer whales, one Atlantic spotted dolphin, one spinner dolphin, or a juvenile Gervais' beaked whale. Hearing impairment could play a significant role in some cetacean stranding events, and the hearing of all cetaceans in rehabilitation should be tested.},

A more productive way forward is to harness new theoretical insights and empirical information on why some reefs degrade and others do not.

Like zooxanthellate corals and other reef organisms with algal symbionts, Amphistegina respond to photoxidative stress by bleaching. This paper documents ultrastructural changes that occur during bleaching under field and laboratory conditions. Nine chambers from the outer whorl of each of 22 normal-appearing and 11 partly bleached specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, which were collected from Conch Reef, Florida, USA, were examined using transmission electron microscopy. The condition and numbers of algal symbionts, as well as the cell area occupied by 10 other intracellular structures of the host, were quantified. Normal-appearing specimens averaged three times more viable symbionts and less than a fourth as many deteriorating symbionts as partly bleached specimens. Foraminifers experimentally exposed to visible light intensities greater than or equal to 13 mumole photon m(-2) s(-1) for 35 d were statistically similar to partly bleached field specimens in the number and condition of symbionts, and in chamber area occupied by the evaluated host structures. Exposure to 32degreesC water temperature at 6-8 mumole photon m(-2) s(-1) for 28 d induced symbiont loss but did not degrade host endoplasm.},

abstract = {Scleractinian corals have demonstrated the ability to shuffle their endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities (genus Symbiodinium) during periods of acute environmental stress. This has been proposed as a mechanism of acclimation, which would be increased by a diverse and flexible association with Symbiodinium. Conventional molecular techniques used to evaluate Symbiodinium diversity are unable to identify genetic lineages present at background levels below 10%. Next generation sequencing (NGS) offers a solution to this problem and can resolve microorganism diversity at much finer scales. Here we apply NGS to evaluate Symbiodinium diversity and host specificity in Acropora corals from contrasting regions of Western Australia. The application of 454 pyrosequencing allowed for detection of Symbiodinium operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurring at frequencies as low as 0.001%, offering a 10,000-fold increase in sensitivity compared to traditional methods. All coral species from both regions were overwhelmingly dominated by a single clade C OTU (accounting for 98% of all recovered sequences). Only 8.5% of colonies associated with multiple clades (clades C and D, or C and G), suggesting a high level of symbiont specificity in Acropora assemblages in Western Australia. While only 40% of the OTUs were shared between regions, the dominance of a single OTU resulted in no significant difference in Symbiodinium community structure, demonstrating that the coral-algal symbiosis can remain stable across more than 15{\textdegree} of latitude and a range of sea surface temperature profiles. This study validates the use of NGS platforms as tools for providing fine-scale estimates of Symbiodinium diversity and can offer critical insight into the flexibility of the coral-algal symbiosis.},

abstract = {Zooxanthellae, algal symbionts in divergent marine invertebrate hosts, are a genetically heterogeneous group. All species descriptions and most physiological and infectivity studies of zooxanthellae have been conducted using cultured material. However, few studies have attempted to quantify the representation of cultures isolated from cnidarians to the in hospite zooxanthella populations of the individual host or host species from which they were established. RFLPs of small subunit (18S) rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS)rDNA sequence data, and microsatellite analyses were conducted to assess the relatedness between cultured zooxanthellae and the in hospite populations of the individual host or host species from which they were isolated. RFLP data demonstrated that cultures may represent either the numerically dominant symbiont or ones present in lower number. ITS-rDNA sequences from zooxanthella. cultures were disconcordant with ITS-rDNA sequences identified from in hospite zooxanthellae of the same host species, and microsatellites present in in hospite zooxanthella populations were absent from the corresponding cultures. Finally, reexamination of the literature revealed examples of zooxanthellar cultures being nonrepresentative of in hospite populations. These data suggest that, in most cases, cultures are a subset of the original in hospite population. Factors such as failing to homogenize bulk cultures before transfer, growth medium used, and the picking of single motile cells may contribute to many zooxanthella cultures being nonrepresentative.},

abstract = {The evolution of tolerance to future climate change depends on the standing stock of genetic variation for resistance to climate-related impacts [1, 2], but genes contributing to climate tolerance in wild populations are poorly described in number and effect. Physiology and gene expression patterns have shown that corals living in naturally high-temperature microclimates are more resistant to bleaching because of both acclimation and fixed effects, including adaptation [3]. To search for potential genetic correlates of these fixed effects, we genotyped 15,399 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 23 individual tabletop corals, Acropora hyacinthus, within a natural temperature mosaic in backreef lagoons on Ofu Island, American Samoa. Despite overall lack of population substructure, we identified 114 highly divergent SNPs as candidates for environmental selection, via multiple stringent outlier tests, and correlations with temperature. Corals from the warmest reef location had higher minor allele frequencies across these candidate SNPs, a pattern not seen for noncandidate loci. Furthermore, within backreef pools, colonies in the warmest microclimates had a higher number and frequency of alternative alleles at candidate loci. These data suggest mild selection for alternate alleles at many loci in these corals during high heat episodes and possible maintenance of extensive polymorphism through multilocus balancing selection in a~heterogeneous environment. In this case, a natural population harbors a reservoir of alleles preadapted to high temperatures, suggesting potential for future evolutionary response to climate change.},

abstract = {Sustainably managing ecosystems is challenging, especially for complex systems such as coral reefs. This study develops critical reference points for sustainable management by using a large empirical dataset on the coral reefs of the western Indian Ocean to investigate associations between levels of target fish biomass (as an indicator of fishing intensity) and eight metrics of ecosystem state. These eight ecological metrics each exhibited specific thresholds along a continuum of fishable biomass ranging from heavily fished sites to old fisheries closures. Three thresholds lay above and five below a hypothesized window of fishable biomass expected to produce a maximum multispecies sustainable yield (B(MMSY)). Evaluating three management systems in nine countries, we found that unregulated fisheries often operate below the B(MMSY), whereas fisheries closures and, less frequently, gear-restricted fisheries were within or above this window. These findings provide tangible management targets for multispecies coral reef fisheries and highlight key tradeoffs required to achieve different fisheries and conservation goals.},

abstract = {The destruction of coral reef habitats has occurred at unprecedented levels during the last three decades. Coral disease and bleaching in the Caribbean and South Florida have caused extensive coral mortality with limited recovery, often coral reefs are being replaced with turf algae. Acroporids were once dominant corals and have diminished to the state where they are being considered as endangered species. Our survey assessed the condition of reef corals throughout South Florida. A probability- based design produced unbiased estimates of the spatial extent of ecological condition, measured as the absence or presence and frequency or prevalence of coral diseases and bleaching intensity over large geographic regions. This approach allowed us to calculate a quantifiable level of uncertainty. Coral condition was estimated for 4100 hectares ( ha) (or 41.0 km(2)) of coral reefs in South Florida, including reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary ( FKNMS), New Grounds, Dry Tortugas National Park ( DTNP), and Biscayne National Park (BNP). The absence or presence of coral disease, 'causal' coral bleaching, partial bleaching and coral paling were not good indicators of overall coral condition. It was more useful to report the prevalence of anomalies that indicated a compromised condition at both the population and community levels. For example, 79% of the area in South Florida had less than 6% of the coral colonies diseased, whereas only 2.2% (97.15 ha) of the sampled area had a maximum prevalence of 13% diseased coral colonies at any single location. The usefulness of 'causal bleaching' might be more important when considering the prevalence of each of the three different states at a single location. For example, paling was observed over the entire area, whereas bleaching and partial bleaching occurred at 19 and 41% of the area, respectively. An index for coral reef condition might integrate the prevalence and species affected by each bleaching state at individual locations. By establishing these baselines, future surveys can examine changes and trends in the spatial distribution of coral conditions in South Florida and able to score the reefs as to their health status.},

abstract = {Studies of Escherichia coli under competition for lactose in chemostat cultures have been used to determine the selective effects of variation in the level of the beta-galactoside permease and the beta-galactosidase enzyme. The results determine the adaptive topography of these gene products relative to growth in limiting lactose and enable predictions concerning the selective effects of genetic variants found in natural populations. In the terms of metabolic control theory, the beta-galactosidase enzyme at wild-type-induced levels has a small control coefficient with respect to fitness (C = 0.018), and hence genetic variants resulting in minor changes in enzyme activity have disproportionately small effects on fitness. However, the apparent control coefficient of the beta-galactoside permease at wild-type-induced levels is large (C = 0.551), and hence even minor changes in activity affect fitness. Therefore, we predict that genetic polymorphisms in the lacZ gene are subject to less effective selection in natural populations than are those in the lacY gene. The beta-galactoside permease is also less efficient than might be expected, and possible forces resulting in selection for an intermediate optimum level of permease activity are considered. The selective forces that maintain the lactose operon in a regulated state in natural populations are also discussed.},

abstract = {A fungus-specific PCR assay using only one primer set has been developed for detecting indoor fungi. Four fungal primer sets, NS3/NS4, NS5/NS6, FF1/FR1 and FF2/FR1, were tested with DNA from humans, rats, mice, bacteria, pollens and six commonly found fungal species (Alternaria chamydospora, Aspergillus flavus, Candida famata, Cladosporium fermentans, Penicillium chrycoIgenum and Stachybotrys chartarum). Results indicated that, although all four primer sets could amplify the fungal DNA, only FF2/FR1 demonstrated no cross-amplification with non-fungal DNA. In addition, these amplified fragments were sequenced to ensure that they indeed matched known fungal DNA sequences. Furthermore, besides the tested fungi, eighteen more genera of fungal sequences were examined and found to match the FF2/FR1. Here, the method of bead-beating was identified as the most effective way for spore breakage and fungal DNA release. The PCR amplification efficiency and potential inhibition were examined using different process solutions and preparation procedures. It was found that, when using 20% nutrient media and homogenization-first procedure, a higher amplification efficiency with less inhibition was achieved. Although positive bands were observed at 0.2 fungal spore/reaction using the homogenization-first procedure, the sensitivity of this assay would be two fungal spores/reaction for environmental samples.},

In this paper, we derive several alternative approximate variance stabilizing transformations that may be easier to use in some applications.

RESULTS:We demonstrate that the started-log and the log-linear-hybrid transformation families can produce approximate variance stabilizing transformations for microarray data that are nearly as good as the generalized logarithm (glog) transformation. These transformations may be more convenient in some applications.},

abstract = {In response to the increases in pCO(2) projected in the 21st century, adult coral growth and calcification are expected to decrease significantly. However, no published studies have investigated the effect of elevated pCO(2) on earlier life history stages of corals. Porites astreoides larvae were collected from reefs in Key Largo, Florida, USA, settled and reared in controlled saturation state seawater. Three saturation states were obtained, using 1 M HCl additions, corresponding to present (380 ppm) and projected pCO(2) scenarios for the years 2065 (560 ppm) and 2100 (720 ppm). The effect of saturation state on settlement and post-settlement growth was evaluated. Saturation state had no significant effect on percent settlement; however, skeletal extension rate was positively correlated with saturation state, with similar to 50% and 78% reductions in growth at the mid and high pCO(2) treatments compared to controls, respectively.},

abstract = {Zooxanthellae are unicellular algae that occur as endosymbionts in many hundreds of marine invertebrate species. Because zooxanthellae have traditionally been difficult to classify, little is known about the natural history of these symbioses. Zooxanthellae were isolated from 131 individuals in 22 host taxa and characterized by the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in nuclear genes that encode small ribosomal subunit RNA (ssRNA). Six algal RFLPs, distributed host species specifically, were detected. Individual hosts contained one algal RFLP. Zooxanthella phylogenetic relationships were estimated from 22 algal ssRNA sequences-one from each host species. Closely related algae were found in dissimilar hosts, suggesting that animal and algal lineages have maintained a flexible evolutionary relation with each other.},

abstract = {The evolutionary success of animal design is strongly affected by scaling and virtually all metazoans are constrained by allometry. One body plan that appears to relax these constraints is a colonial modular (CM) design, in which modular iteration is hypothesized to support isometry and indeterminate colony size. In this study, growth rates of juvenile scleractinians (less than 40mm diameter) with a CM design were used to test this assertion using colony diameters recorded annually for a decade and scaling exponents (b) for growth calculated from double logarithmic plots of final versus initial diameters. For all juvenile corals, b differed significantly among years, with isometry (b=1) in 4 years, but positive allometry (b>1) in 5 years. The study years were characterized by differences in seawater temperature that were associated significantly with b for growth, with isometry in warm years but positive allometry in cool years. These results illustrate variable growth scaling in a CM taxon and suggest that the switch between scaling modes is mediated by temperature. For the corals studied, growth was not constrained by size, but this outcome was achieved through both isometry and positive allometry. Under cooler conditions, positive allometry may be beneficial as it represents a growth advantage that increases with size.},

abstract = {The proportion of human genetic variation due to differences between populations is modest, and individuals from different populations can be genetically more similar than individuals from the same population. Yet sufficient genetic data can permit accurate classification of individuals into populations. Both findings can be obtained from the same data set, using the same number of polymorphic loci. This article explains Our analysis focuses on the frequency, omega, with which a pair of random individuals from two different populations is genetically more similar than a pair of individuals randomly selected from any single population. We compare w to the error rates of several classification methods, using data sets that vary in number of loci, average allele frequency, populations sampled, and polymorphism ascertainment strategy. We demonstrate that classification methods achieve higher discriminatory power than omega because of their use of aggregate properties of populations. The number of loci analyzed is the most critical variable: with 100 polymorphisins, accurate classification is possible, but omega remains sizable, even when using populations as distinct as sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans. Phenotypes controlled by a dozen or fewer loci can therefore be expected to show substantial overlap between human Populations. This provides empirical justification for caution when rising population labels in biomedical settings, with broad implications for personalized medicine, pharmacogenetics, and the meaning of race.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals host assemblages of symbiotic algae ( Symbiodinium spp.) whose diversity and abundance may fluctuate under different conditions, potentially facilitating acclimatization to environmental change. The composition of free-living Symbiodinium in reef waters and sediments may also be environmentally labile and may influence symbiotic assemblages by mediating supply and dispersal. The magnitude and spatial scales of environmental influence over Symbiodinium composition in different reef habitat compartments are, however, not well understood. We used pyrosequencing to compare Symbiodinium in sediments, water, and ten coral species between two backreef pools in American Samoa with contrasting thermal environments. We found distinct compartmental assemblages of clades A, C, D, F, and/or G Symbiodinium types, with strong differences between pools in water, sediments, and two coral species. In the pool with higher and more variable temperatures, abundance of various clade A and C types differed compared to the other pool, while abundance of D types was lower in sediments but higher in water and in Pavona venosa , revealing an altered habitat distribution and potential linkages among compartments. The lack of between-pool effects in other coral species was due to either low overall variability (in the case of Porites ) or high within-pool variability. Symbiodinium communities in water and sediment also showed within-pool structure, indicating that environmental influences may operate over multiple, small spatial scales. This work suggests that Symbiodinium composition is highly labile in reef waters, sediments, and some corals, but the underlying drivers and functional consequences of this plasticity require further testing with high spatial resolution biological and environmental sampling.},

All of the published descriptions are based on tissue that was tired in standard aldehyde and osmium fixatives and dehydrated in an ethanol series before embedding. When the technique of freeze-substitution was used to fix tissue from Cassiopeia xamachana, Aiptasia pallida, and Phyllactis flosculifera and prepare it for embedding, thecal vesicles were revealed within the in situ symbionts of all three species. Although these structures have been identified in cultured symbionts, they have never been described in the in situ symbionts. A review of the literature has revealed several instances where thecal vesicles were either overlooked or identified incorrectly. Thus the formal description of the genus Symbiodinium, which describes the in situ symbionts, contains information that is based on artifact and should be revised. A revision of the genus is suggested, and the true nature of these structures and their significance in the symbiotic association are discussed.},

abstract = {Survival of free-living and symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) in coral reefs is critical to the maintenance of a healthy coral community. Most coral reefs exist in oligotrophic waters, and their survival strategy in such nutrient-depleted waters remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that two strains of Symbiodinium spp. cultured from the environment and acquired from the tissues of the coral Alveopora japonica had the ability to feed heterotrophically. Symbiodinium spp. fed on heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.), and small microalgae in both nutrient-replete and nutrient-depleted conditions. Cultured free-living Symbiodinium spp. displayed no autotrophic growth under nitrogen-depleted conditions, but grew when provided with prey. Our results indicate that Symbiodinium spp.'s mixotrophic activity greatly increases their chance of survival and their population growth under nitrogen-depleted conditions, which tend to prevail in coral habitats. In particular, free-living Symbiodinium cells acquired considerable nitrogen from algal prey, comparable to or greater than the direct uptake of ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, or urea. In addition, free-living Symbiodinium spp. can be a sink for planktonic cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.) and remove substantial portions of Synechococcus populations from coral reef waters. Our discovery of Symbiodinium's feeding alters our conventional views of the survival strategies of photosynthetic Symbiodinium and corals.},

abstract = {Colonial metazoans often encrust surfaces over which the food supply varies in time or space. In such an environment, adaptive colony development entails adjusting the timing and spacing of feeding structures and gastrovascular connections to correspond to this variable food supply. To investigate the possibility of such adaptive growth, within-colony differential feeding experiments were carried out using the hydroid Podocoryna carnea. Indeed, such colonies strongly exhibited adaptive growth, developing dense arrays of polyps (feeding structures) and gastrovascular connections in areas that were fed relative to areas that were starved, and this effect became more consistent over time. To investigate mechanisms of signaling between the food supply and colony development, measurements were taken of metabolic parameters that have been implicated in signal transduction in other systems, particularly redox state and levels of reactive oxygen species. Utilizing fluorescence microscopy of P. carnea cells in vivo, simultaneous measurements of redox state [using NAD(P)H] and hydrogen peroxide (using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate) were taken. Both measures focused on polyp epitheliomuscular cells, since these exhibit the greatest metabolic activity. Colonies 3-5h after feeding were relatively oxidized, with low levels of peroxide, while colonies 24h after feeding were relatively reduced, with high levels of peroxide. The functional role of polyps in feeding and generating gastrovascular flow probably produced this dichotomy. Polyps 3-5h after feeding contract maximally, and this metabolic demand probably shifts the redox state in the direction of oxidation and diminishes levels of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, 24h after feeding, polyps are quiescent, and this lack of metabolic demand probably shifts the redox state in the direction of reduction and increases levels of reactive oxygen species. Within-colony differential feeding experiments were carried out on colonies 24h after the usual, colony-wide feeding. At this time, a single polyp was fed, and this polyp was compared with an otherwise similar polyp from the same colony. A pattern similar to the whole-colony experiments was obtained: the just-fed polyp, as it begins contracting shortly after feeding, appears to be relatively oxidized, with low levels of peroxide compared with the polyp that was not fed. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptive colony development in response to a variable food supply is mediated by redox state or reactive oxygen species or both, although alternative hypotheses are also discussed.},

Metacommunity theory can integrate these local- and regional-scale dynamics to explore symbiont community composition patterns across space. In this article I emphasize that symbionts should be incorporated into the metacommunity concept. I highlight the utility of metacommunity theory by discussing practical and general benefits that emerge from considering symbionts in a metacommunity framework. Specifically, investigating the local and regional drivers of symbiont community and metacommunity structure will lead to a more holistic understanding of symbiont ecology and evolution and could reveal novel insights into the roles of symbiont communities in mediating host health.},

abstract = {Bleaching episodes caused by increasing seawater temperatures may induce mass coral mortality and are regarded as one of the biggest threats to coral reef ecosystems worldwide. The current consensus is that this phenomenon results from enhanced production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) that disrupt the symbiosis between corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, Symbiodinium . Here, the responses of two important antioxidant defence components, the host coenzyme Q (CoQ) and symbiont plastoquinone (PQ) pools, are investigated for the first time in colonies of the scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora , during experimentally-induced bleaching under ecologically relevant conditions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the states of these two pools, together with physiological parameters assessing the general state of the symbiosis (including photosystem II photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodinium cell densities). The results show that the responses of the two antioxidant systems occur on different timescales: ( i ) the redox state of the Symbiodinium PQ pool remained stable until twelve days into the experiment, after which there was an abrupt oxidative shift; ( ii ) by contrast, an oxidative shift of approximately 10% had occurred in the host CoQ pool after 6 days of thermal stress, prior to significant changes in any other physiological parameter measured. Host CoQ pool oxidation is thus an early biomarker of thermal stress in corals, and this antioxidant pool is likely to play a key role in quenching thermally-induced ROS in the coral-algal symbiosis. This study adds to a growing body of work that indicates host cellular responses may precede the bleaching process and symbiont dysfunction.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching involves the loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) from reef corals and other cnidarians and may be a stress response of the host, algae or both. To determine the role of zooxanthellae in the bleaching process, aposymbiotic sea anemones from Bermuda (Aiptasia pallida) were infected with symbionts from other sea anemones (Aiptasia pallida from Florida, Bartholomea annulata and Condylactis gigantea). The expulsion of algae was measured during 24-h incubations at 25, 32 and 34 degreesC. Photosynthetic rates of freshly isolated zooxanthellae were also measured at these temperatures. The C. gigantea (Cg) symbionts were expelled in higher numbers than the other algae at 32 degreesC. Photosynthesis by the Cg algae was completely inhibited at this temperature, in contrast to the other symbionts. At 34 degrees all of the symbionts had increased expulsion rates, and at this temperature only the symbionts from Florida A. pallida exhibited any photosynthesis. These results provide the first evidence that the differential release of symbionts from the same host species is related to decreased photosynthesis at elevated temperatures, and support other findings suggesting that zooxanthellae are directly affected by elevated temperatures during bleaching events.

abstract = {Interspecific mutualisms are often vulnerable to instability because low benefit : cost ratios can rapidly lead to extinction or to the conversion of mutualism to parasite-host or predator-prey interactions. We hypothesize that the evolutionary stability of mutualism can depend on how benefits and costs to one mutualist vary with the population density of its partner, and that stability can be maintained if a mutualist can influence demographic rates and regulate the population density of its partner. We test this hypothesis in a model of mutualism with key features of senita cactus (Pachycereus schottii)-senita moth (Upiga virescens) interactions, in which benefits of pollination and costs of larval seed consumption to plant fitness depend on pollinator density. We show that plants can maximize their fitness by allocating resources to the production of excess flowers at the expense of fruit. Fruit abortion resulting from excess flower production reduces pre-adult survival of the pollinating seed-consumer, and maintains its density beneath a threshold that would destabilize the mutualism. Such a strategy of excess flower production and fruit abortion is convergent and evolutionarily stable against invasion by cheater plants that produce few flowers and abort few to no fruit. This novel mechanism of achieving evolutionarily stable mutualism, namely interspecific population regulation, is qualitatively different from other mechanisms invoking partner choice or selective rewards, and may be a general process that helps to preserve mutualistic interactions in nature.},

abstract = {Cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses are ecologically important and the subject of much investigation. However, our understanding of critical aspects of symbiosis physiology, such as the partitioning of total respiration between the host and symbiont, remains incomplete. Specifically, we know little about how the relationship between host and symbiont respiration varies between different holobionts (host-symbiont combinations). We applied molecular and biochemical techniques to investigate aerobic respiratory capacity in naturally symbiotic Exaiptasia pallida sea anemones, alongside animals infected with either homologous ITS2-type A4 Symbiodinium or a heterologous isolate of Symbiodinium minutum (ITS2-type B1). In naturally symbiotic anemones, host, symbiont, and total holobiont mitochondrial citrate synthase (CS) enzyme activity, but not host mitochondrial copy number, were reliable predictors of holobiont respiration. There was a positive association between symbiont density and host CS specific activity (mg protein-1), and a negative correlation between host- and symbiont CS specific activities. Notably, partitioning of total CS activity between host and symbiont in this natural E. pallida population was significantly different to the host/symbiont biomass ratio. In re-infected anemones, we found significant between-holobiont differences in the CS specific activity of the algal symbionts. Furthermore, the relationship between the partitioning of total CS activity and the host/symbiont biomass ratio differed between holobionts. These data have broad implications for our understanding of cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Specifically, the long-held assumption of equivalency between symbiont/host biomass and respiration ratios can result in significant overestimation of symbiont respiration and potentially erroneous conclusions regarding the percentage of carbon translocated to the host. The interspecific variability in symbiont aerobic capacity provides further evidence for distinct physiological differences that should be accounted for when studying diverse host-symbiont combinations.},

abstract = {Hard corals are a living association of a cnidarian and microalgae of the genus Symbiodinium. This symbiosis is critical for corals to survive in oligotrophic tropical waters. The algal symbionts reside within the host cells receiving photosynthetic substrate in form of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and in turn transfer photosynthate to their coral host. The photosynthetic performance of the algal symbionts is directly dependent on the DIC substrate delivery, which in turn can have implications on the photosynthate translocation to their coral hosts. Under thermal and or high light stress, the algal symbiont{\textquoteright}s photosynthetic substrate can become limited, so that the photosynthetic rate slows down and excess light energy, not utilised for photosynthesis, is dissipated to avoid photodamage. Upon prolonged exposure under these stress conditions, the symbiotic association can dissociate and result in coral bleaching. It was of interest to understand ongoing processes governing the dissociation of a coral symbiosis, focussing on cultured algal symbionts as well as when associated with a coral host. The photosynthetic apparatus of Symbiodinium has different pathways for dissipating excess energy to alleviate the impact of high light stress. Here a novel non-photochemical quenching mechanism was described through the application of picosecond chlorophyll fluorescence measurements on Symbiodinium clade C cells suggesting a heterogeneously organized photosystem II (PSII) pool. A model was developed, revealing the re-organization of the alga{\textquoteright}s photosynthetic apparatus under normal and photoprotective modes, during thermal and high light stress. We propose a new {\textquotedblleft}super-quenching{\textquotedblright} mechanism, triggered when quenching at the peripheral antennas is insufficient to protect PSII from photodamage. PSII then transfers its excited state energy to PSI, transforming a non-spillover PSII pool into a spillover pool. The inherently higher stability of PSI and high quenching efficiency of P₇₀₀⁺ allows dumping excess energy to heat, and resulting in an almost complete cessation of photosynthetic electron transport. A similar breakdown of Symbiodinium{\textquoteright}s photosynthesis could occur when living in hospite associated with corals and this could provide a trigger for coral bleaching. Symbiodinium is equipped with light-harvesting and reaction centre components in the thylakoid membrane including a water-soluble peridinin-chlorophyll (chl) a-protein complex (PCP), and a membrane-bound chl a-chl c₂{\textendash}peridinin- protein complex (acpPC), along with typical photosynthetic electron transport systems such as the PSII reaction centre and the chl a-P₇₀₀ reaction centre complex of PSI. Recent findings suggest that structural changes to PSII associated light harvesting pigment-protein antenna complexes (LHC), membrane intrinsic acpPC and peripherally associated PCP, in Symbiodinium are a mean of photoprotection, in addition to xanthophyll cycling. How LHC movement and xanthophyll cycling possibly complement each other under thermal and high light conditions, corresponding to coral bleaching conditions (the expulsion of algal symbionts from the coral host) has been addressed in this thesis. Here it could be revealed that thermal stress is the main precursor for movement of light harvesting complexes in order to shunt excess energy away from PSII. The findings presented here demonstrate the substantial non-photochemical quenching capacity of cultured Symbiodinium. Coral bleaching resilience has been found to be species-specific, with differential impairment of Symbiodinium{\textquoteright}s photobiology. Whilst much is known about the importance of considering Symbiodinium clades and resulting differential photophysiological characteristics affecting the overall coral physiology, the influence of the host upon autotrophic/photophysiological performance of their symbionts is largely unstudied. With the application of an inhibitor preventing the de novo synthesis of the PSII core protein D1, coral species were incubated in natural high light stress conditions for 4 days. Gross photoinhibitory conditions of Symbiodinium clade C1 were examined when harboured in two distinct coral host organisms. Algal symbionts harboured in Pavona decussata, a bleaching resilient coral species displayed lower photodamage, compared to algal symbionts harboured in Pocillopora damicornis, a bleaching sensitive coral species, which was found to exhibit different photoprotective strategies. Despite differences in photodamage and resulting photorepair requirements (re-synthesis of D1 and incorporation in the PSII to create a functional reaction centre), both species displayed constant maximum quantum yields throughout exposure to high light conditions. Results clearly suggest that the photophysiological viability of Symbiodinium can be influenced depending on the harbouring coral host species. In order to understand intricate physiological processes occurring in a coral holobiont and to further assess interdependencies of a Symbiodinium-coral host symbiosis, a closed metabolic chamber system (photobioreactor; PBR) was developed for the simultaneous assessment of three key integrated parameters of aquatic oxygenic phototrophs; chlorophyll fluorometry, oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) exchange. The performance of the PBR was evaluated for in hospite Symbiodinium associated with the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis. The {\textquoteleft}two-phase{\textquoteright} PBR utilised circulation of a gas-phase through a liquid-phase (seawater) along with continuous stirring to reach equilibrium and allowed for determination of CO₂ as an indirect measure of changes in DIC concentration within the liquid-phase. Simultaneous measures of photosynthetic efficiency (using pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry) and metabolic gas exchange (using state-of-the art dissolved oxygen sensor technology and an infra-red gas analyser for CO₂ detection) were performed. The developed instrumental setup can be used to examine any aquatic phototroph, where the preliminary results presented, show the great capacity of this application. Further, the novel PBR and additional O₂ microsensors were used to examine the photophysiology and metabolic gas exchange of the symbiont subclade (C1) harboured in two morphologically different coral species; Pocillopora damicornis and Pavona decussata. Here light respiratory dynamics were described through the application of O₂ microsensors under photosynthesis {\textendash} irradiance (P {\textendash} E) curve measurements. Comparable light respiratory dynamics but differing gross primary production, as well as light utilisation were found between the two species examined. P. decussata, displayed a much lower CO₂ light compensation point at only half the photon flux density compared to P. damicornis, indicating differing DIC supply to its algal symbionts. It was therefore concluded that P. damicornis has a comparable respiratory activity per symbiont to P. decussata, but as P. damicornis harbours less than half the symbionts per unit area compared to P. decussata, the holobiont exhibits a higher CO₂ compensation point (CO₂Ec) irradiance. Dissipative energy pathways also differed during photosynthesis-irradiance (P {\textendash} E) curve measurements, where P. decussata displayed an increase of non-light induced energy quenching (Y(NO)) and P. damicornis increased active energy quenching (Y(NPQ)). O₂ microsensor derived light respiration rates were demonstrated for the first time from P {\textendash} E curve measurements for coral holobionts. This is a significant contribution to the field as respiration increased with irradiance {\textasciitilde} 20 times compared to steady-state dark respiration for both species. Light respiration rate results demonstrated here clearly highlight that enhanced post-illumination rates, which have commonly been used to infer about light respiratory activity, are not reflecting the much greater actual light respiratory activity. In concert, this thesis has revealed that Symbiodinium is equipped with a broad capacity of non-photochemical quenching pathways, where the species-specific pairing of Symbiodinium and its coral host can mediate photoprotective capacity. The importance of sufficient DIC as photosynthetic substrate available to the algal symbionts has been identified as a possible key role governing bleaching resilience in hard coral species.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching caused by heat stress is accompanied by photoinhibition, which occurs under conditions where the rate of photo-damage to photosystem II (PSII) exceeds the rate of its repair, in the symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium spp.) within corals. However, the mechanism of heat stress-induced photoinhibition in Symbiodinium still remains poorly understood. In the present work, we have investigated the effect of elevated temperature on the processes associated with the repair of photodamaged PSII in cultured Symbiodinium (OTcH-1 and CS-73). Severe photoinhibition was observed at temperature exceeding 32 degrees C in Symbiodinium CS-73 cells grown at 25-34 degrees C but not in cultures of the more thermally tolerant Symbiodinium OTcH-1. After photoinhibition treatment by strong light, photodamaged PSII was repaired close to initial levels under low light at 25 degrees C in both OTcH-1 and CS-73. However, the repair was strongly inhibited by increased temperature exceeding 31 degrees C in CS-73 but only weakly in OTcH-1. We found that inhibition of the repair process in CS-73 is attributed to impairment of both protein synthesis-dependent and-independent repair processes and is at least partially caused by suppression of the de novo synthesis of thylakoid membrane proteins and impairment of the generation of Delta pH across the thylakoid membrane, respectively. Our results suggest that acceleration of photoinhibition by moderate heat stress is attributed primarily to inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII and that the photoinhibition sensitivity of Symbiodinium to heat stress is determined by the thermal sensitivity of the PSII repair processes.},

abstract = {The response of chlorophyll-protein complexes to super- and sub-saturating photon-flux densities, PFD (250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) and 40 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), respectively) were analyzed for Symbiodinium microadriaticum Freudenthal, the symbiont of the Caribbean jellyfish Cassiopeia xamachana; S. kawagutii Trench and Blank, the symbiont of the Indo-Pacific scleractinian Montipora verrucosa; and S. pilosum Trench and Blank, the symbiont of the Carribbean zoanthid Zoanthus sociatus. The results indicate that each species exhibits a quantitatively distinct chlorophyll (chi) a distribution among its chl-protein complexes when cultured under standardized high and low light conditions. In response to sub-saturating PFD, the three species differentially increased the cellular concentrations of most of the chl-protein complexes. Increases in P-700 (reaction center of Photosystem I) under sub-saturating PFD correlate with an increase in the cellular concentrations of the Photosystem I-enriched complexes. Similarly, increases in photosynthetic unit (PSU) size correlate with an increase in the cellular concentrations of the water-soluble peridinin-chl-a-protein (PCP) complexes and the membrane-bound chl a-chl c(2)-peridinin-protein (acpPC) complexes, which together represent the light-harvesting components of this group. In S. microadriaticum, acclimation to sub-saturating PFD uniquely includes the preferential enrichment of the dimeric form of PCP. Under super-saturating PFD, an enrichment in photo-protective xanthophylls was detected in acpPC from S. microadriaticum and S. pilosum, but not from S. kawagutii. Each species demonstrated a characteristic photo-acclimatory response which correlates with its distribution as endosymbiont in nature, supporting the concept that different species of symbiotic dinoflagellates are adapted (sensu Bjorkman 1981) to different photic environments. The study was conducted between May 1992 and November 1994.},

For this, we propose a simplified optical model of the coral and describe in some detail methods for characterizing the coral skeleton and the layer containing the symbiotic algae. The model is used to study the absorption of light by the layer of tissue containing the microalgae by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that, through scattering, the skeleton homogenizes and enhances the light environment in which the symbionts live. We also present results that illustrate the modification of the internal light environment when the corals loose symbionts or pigmentation.},

abstract = {Symbioses play an important role within the marine environment. Among the most well known of these symbioses is that between coral and the photosynthetic dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium spp. Understanding the metabolic relationships between the host and the symbiont is of the utmost importance in order to gain insight into how this symbiosis may be disrupted due to environmental stressors. Here we summarize the metabolites related to nutritional roles, diel cycles and the common metabolites associated with the invertebrate-Symbiodinium relationship. We also review the more obscure metabolites and toxins that have been identified through natural products and biomarker research. Finally, we discuss the key role that metabolomics and functional genomics will play in understanding these important symbioses.},

abstract = {Many eukaryotes have obligate associations with microorganisms that are transmitted directly between generations. A model for heritable symbiosis is the association of aphids, a clade of sap-feeding insects, and Buchnera aphidicola, a gammaproteobacterium that colonized an aphid ancestor 150 million years ago and persists in almost all 5,000 aphid species. Symbiont acquisition enables evolutionary and ecological expansion; aphids are one of many insect groups that would not exist without heritable symbiosis. Receiving less attention are potential negative ramifications of symbiotic alliances. In the short run, symbionts impose metabolic costs. Over evolutionary time, hosts evolve dependence beyond the original benefits of the symbiosis. Symbiotic partners enter into an evolutionary spiral that leads to irreversible codependence and associated risks. Host adaptations to symbiosis (e.g., immune-system modification) may impose vulnerabilities. Symbiont genomes also continuously accumulate deleterious mutations, limiting their beneficial contributions and environmental tolerance. Finally, the fitness interests of obligate heritable symbionts are distinct from those of their hosts, leading to selfish tendencies. Thus, genes underlying the host-symbiont interface are predicted to follow a coevolutionary arms race, as observed for genes governing host-pathogen interactions. On the macroevolutionary scale, the rapid evolution of interacting symbiont and host genes is predicted to accelerate host speciation rates by generating genetic incompatibilities. However, degeneration of symbiont genomes may ultimately limit the ecological range of host species, potentially increasing extinction risk. Recent results for the aphid-Buchnera symbiosis and related systems illustrate that, whereas heritable symbiosis can expand ecological range and spur diversification, it also presents potential perils.},

abstract = {Chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has contributed to amphibian population declines and extinctions worldwide. The impact of this pathogen, however, varies markedly among amphibian species and populations. Following invasion into some areas of California's Sierra Nevada, Bd leads to rapid declines and local extinctions of frog populations (Rana muscosa, R. sierrae). In other areas, infected populations of the same frog species have declined but persisted at low host densities for many years. We present results of a 5-year study showing that infected adult frogs in persistent populations have low fungal loads, are surviving between years, and frequently lose and regain the infection. Here we put forward the hypothesis that fungal load dynamics can explain the different population-level outcomes of Bd observed in different areas of the Sierra Nevada and possibly throughout the world. We develop a model that incorporates the biological details of the Bd-host interaction. Importantly, model results suggest that host persistence versus extinction does not require differences in host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, or environmental conditions, and may be just epidemic and endemic population dynamics of the same host-pathogen system. The different disease outcomes seen in natural populations may result solely from density-dependent host-pathogen dynamics. The model also shows that persistence of Bd is enhanced by the long-lived tadpole stage that characterize these two frog species, and by nonhost Bd reservoirs.},

abstract = {Bacterial heterotrophs were isolated from the water mass and from the surface mucopolysaccharide layers of normal Acropora cervicornis (staghorn coral) and A. cervicornis showing signs of white-band disease. Each isolate was exposed to 95 different carbon sources, and the percentages of isolates from each community were compared with respect to their ability to utilize each carbon source. Six-carbon sugars were preferentially metabolized by the white-band community while five-carbon sugars were preferentially used by the normal coral community. More organic and amino acids preferentially were oxidized by the white-band community over the other communities tested. In addition, pyrimidines, glycerol, and phosphorylated compounds also were preferential for the white-band community. This community was less diverse than other communities. These results support previous taxonomic comparisons and may yield insights into the overall pathogenesis of the disease.},

Here we experimentally change the zooxanthellae densities in branches of Stylophora pistillata corals through starvation and osmotic shock. We follow the subsequent changes of the zooxanthellae population dynamics. Prolonged starvation (40 days) caused a 50% loss of zooxanthellae, a 70% decrease in photosynthesis (P calculated per polyp), a 3-fold decrease in proliferating zooxanthellae frequency (PZF) and two-three-fold increase in degrading zooxanthellae frequency (DZF). The increase of the numbers of zooxanthellae in various stages of degradation was closely coupled to an increase in the release of degraded zooxanthellae particles (dzp). At the same time, zooxanthellae volume increased by 80% but chlorophyll content and the photosynthetic capacity of the zooxanthellae did not change. Polyps subjected to osmotic shock (17 parts per thousand) expelled about one third of their zooxanthellae along with elements of animal cells. PZF and DZF levels varied slightly. We assume that zooxanthellae densities in corals are a consequence of differential rates of zooxanthellae division and degradation regulated by the coral host. Only under extreme conditions are zooxanthellae population densities regulated by expulsion of healthy zooxanthellae.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Declining water quality coupled with the effects of climate change are rapidly increasing coral diseases on reefs worldwide, although links between coral diseases and environmental parameters remain poorly understood. This is the first study to document a correlation between coral disease and water quality on an inshore reef.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:The temporal dynamics of the coral disease atramentous necrosis (AN) was investigated over two years within inshore populations of Montipora aequituberculata in the central Great Barrier Reef, in relation to rainfall, salinity, temperature, water column chlorophyll a, suspended solids, sedimentation, dissolved organic carbon, and particulate nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon. Overall, mean AN prevalence was 10-fold greater during summer wet seasons than winter dry seasons. A 2.5-fold greater mean disease abundance was detected during the summer of 2009 (44 {\textpm} SE 6.7 diseased colonies per 25 m(2)), when rainfall was 1.6-fold greater than in the summer of 2008. Two water quality parameters explained 67% of the variance in monthly disease prevalence in a Partial Least Squares regression analysis; disease abundance was negatively correlated with salinity (R2 = -0.6) but positively correlated with water column particulate organic carbon concentration (R2 = 0.32). Seasonal temperature patterns were also positively correlated with disease abundance, but explained only a small portion of the variance.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:The results suggest that rainfall and associated runoff may facilitate seasonal disease outbreaks, potentially by reducing host fitness or by increasing pathogen virulence due to higher availability of nutrients and organic matter. In the future, rainfall and seawater temperatures are likely to increase due to climate change which may lead to decreased health of inshore reefs.},

abstract = {Bleaching in stony corals is the result of a disruption of the symbiosis between the coral hosts and photosynthetic microalgal endosymbionts (zooxanthellae). Coral bleaching may be induced by a variety of environmental stimuli, including increased seawater temperature. Large-scale bleaching episodes have been suggested to be linked to global warming. We have discovered that coral bleaching, in this case, bleaching of the Mediterranean coral Oculina patagonica, is caused by a bacterid infection and that water temperature is a contributing factor. The causative agent, Vibrio AK-1, was present in 28 bleached O. patagonica examined, but absent from 24 healthy (unbleached) corals. The Vibrio sp. was isolated in pure culture, characterized microbiologically, and shown to cause bleaching when inoculated onto unbleached corals. An increase in seawater temperature may influence the outcome of bacterial infection by lowering the resistance of the coral to infection and/or increasing the virulence of the bacterium. When inoculated with 10(6) Vibrio AK-1 ml(-1) at 26 degrees C, bleaching began at around 10 d and affected more than 80% of the corals after 44 d. Bleaching did not occur under the same conditions in the presence of antibiotics or if the temperature was lowered to 16 degrees C.},

abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution has been instrumental in organizing our thinking about the nature of evolutionary forces shaping variation at the DNA level. More importantly, it has provided empiricists with a strong set of testable predictions and hence, a useful null hypothesis against which to test for the presence of selection. Evidence indicates that the neutral theory cannot explain key features of protein evolution nor patterns of biased codon usage in certain species. Whereas we now have a reasonable model of selection acting on synonymous changes in Drosophila, protein evolution remains poorly understood. Despite limitations in the applicability of the neutral theory, it is likely to remain an integral part of the quest to understand molecular evolution.},

Understanding the factors that underlie changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota will aid in the design of therapies that target it. This goal is formidable. The gut microbiota is immensely diverse, varies between individuals and can fluctuate over time - especially during disease and early development.

abstract = {Reef-building corals and many other cnidarians are symbiotic with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. It has long been known that the endosymbiotic algae transfer much of their photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host and that this can provide much of the host's total energy. However, it has remained unclear which metabolite(s) are directly translocated from the algae into the host tissue. We reexamined this question in the small sea anemone Aiptasia using labeling of intact animals in the light with (13)C-bicarbonate, rapid homogenization and separation of animal and algal fractions, and analysis of metabolite labeling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found labeled glucose in the animal fraction within 2 min of exposure to (13)C-bicarbonate, whereas no significant labeling of other compounds was observed within the first 10 min. Although considerable previous evidence has suggested that glycerol might be a major translocated metabolite, we saw no significant labeling of glycerol within the first hour, and incubation of intact animals with (13)C-labeled glycerol did not result in a rapid production of (13)C-glucose. In contrast, when Symbiodinium cells freshly isolated from host tissue were exposed to light and (13)C-bicarbonate in the presence of host homogenate, labeled glycerol, but not glucose, was detected in the medium. We also observed early production of labeled glucose, but not glycerol, in three coral species. Taken together, the results suggest that glucose is the major translocated metabolite in dinoflagellate-cnidarian symbiosis and that the release of glycerol from isolated algae may be part of a stress response.},

Subsequently, RNA, DNA and protein were extracted sequentially from colonies exposed to elevated (30{\textdegree}C) temperature for 48 hours. From the RNA phase, a heat shock protein-70 ( hsp70 )-like gene, deemed hsp/c , was identified in the coral host, and expression of this gene was measured with real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in both the host anthozoan and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium ). While mRNA levels were not affected by temperature in either member, hsp/c expression was temporally variable in both and co-varied within biopsies. From the DNA phase, host and Symbiodinium hsp/c genome copy proportions (GCPs) were calculated to track changes in the biological composition of the holobiont during the experiment. While there was no temperature effect on either host or Symbiodinium GCP, both demonstrated significant temporal variation. Finally, total soluble protein was responsive to neither temperature nor exposure time, though the protein/DNA ratio varied significantly over time. Collectively, it appears that time, and not temperature, is a more important driver of the variation in these parameters, highlighting the need to consider natural variation in both gene expression and the molecular make-up of coral holobionts when conducting manipulative studies. This represents the first study to survey multiple macromolecules from both compartments of an endosymbiotic organism with methodologies that reflect their dual-compartmental nature, ideally generating a framework for assessing molecular-level changes within corals and other endosymbioses exposed to changes in their environment.},

When the reef-building coral Acropora digitifera was exposed to light, a moderate increase of temperature induced coral bleaching through photobleaching of algal pigments, but not through expulsion of symbiotic algae. Monitoring of PSII photoinhibition revealed that heat-dependent photoinhibition was ascribed to inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII, and heat susceptibility of the repair machinery varied among coral species. We conclude that the efficiency of the photosynthesis repair machinery determines the bleaching susceptibility of coral species under elevated seawater temperatures.},

abstract = {Dinoflagellates are unicellular algae that are ubiquitously abundant in aquatic environments. Species of the genus Symbiodinium form symbiotic relationships with reef-building corals and other marine invertebrates. Despite their ecologic importance, little is known about the genetics of dinoflagellates in general and Symbiodinium in particular. Here, we used 454 sequencing to generate transcriptome data from two Symbiodinium species from different clades (clade A and clade B). With more than 56,000 assembled sequences per species, these data represent the largest transcriptomic resource for dinoflagellates to date. Our results corroborate previous observations that dinoflagellates possess the complete nucleosome machinery. We found a complete set of core histones as well as several H3 variants and H2A.Z in one species. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis points toward a low number of transcription factors in Symbiodinium spp. that also differ in the distribution of DNA-binding domains relative to other eukaryotes. In particular the cold shock domain was predominant among transcription factors. Additionally, we found a high number of antioxidative genes in comparison to non-symbiotic but evolutionary related organisms. These findings might be of relevance in the context of the role that Symbiodinium spp. play as coral symbionts.Our data represent the most comprehensive dinoflagellate EST data set to date. This study provides a comprehensive resource to further analyze the genetic makeup, metabolic capacities, and gene repertoire of Symbiodinium and dinoflagellates. Overall, our findings indicate that Symbiodinium possesses some unique characteristics, in particular the transcriptional regulation in Symbiodinium may differ from the currently known mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation.},

abstract = {Zooxanthellae are phototrophic dinoflagellates that occur as endosymbionts in many marine invertebrates. Because traditional biological methods have not provided useful schemes for zooxanthella identification and classification, the natural history of zooxanthella symbioses is poorly known. We have applied molecular genetic methods to zooxanthella taxonomy. Small ribosomal subunit RNA (ssRNA) genes can be rapidly obtained from small amounts of symbiotic (non-cultured) algae by gene amplification using the polymerase chain reaction. Different Symbiodinium-like zooxanthellae are then identified by digesting the amplified DNA with restriction enzymes. A sample of 16 cnidarian host species yielded 6 distinct Symbiodinium ssRNA genes: different Hawaiian corals harbored different algae, but different individuals of the same coral species harbored indistinguishable algae. The corals Pocillopora damicornis and P. meandrina appear to contain a mixture of 2 zooxanthella ssRNA genes; other hosts exhibited a single zooxanthella genotype. The same algal genotype occurs in taxonomically dissimilar hosts.},

Here we describe the isolation and characterisation of an ancient mannose-binding lectin in the coral Acropora millepora, which is likely to be involved in both processes. The lectin ('Millectin') was isolated by affinity chromatography and was shown to bind to bacterial. pathogens as well as coral symbionts, dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. cDNA analysis of Millectin indicate extensive sequence variation in the binding region, reflecting its ability to recognise various mannose-like carbohydrate structures on non-self cells, including symbionts and pathogens. This is the first mannose-binding lectin to show extensive sequence variability as observed for pattern recognition proteins in other invertebrate immune systems and, given that invertebrates rely on non-adaptive immunity, is a potential keystone component of coral defence mechanisms.

However, recent work demonstrates that dispersal can drastically alter the interplay between ecological and evolutionary dynamics, often in unexpected ways. We argue that a dispersal-centered synthesis of metacommunity ecology and evolution is necessary to make further progress in this important area of research. We demonstrate that such an approach generates several novel outcomes and substantially enhances understanding of both ecological and evolutionary phenomena in three core research areas at the interface of ecology and evolution.},

The numbers of live, dead, and mitotic Symbiodinium cells lost from three scleractinian corals from three different families ( Acropora hyacinthus, Favites complanata, and Porites solida), which have not been studied previously in central Queensland ( Australia), were compared at 28, 30, 32, and 34degreesC. Specific expulsion rates, growth rates, and mitotic indices were compared for each host at each temperature. Porites solida was the most robust coral, A. hyacinthus bleached more readily at low temperatures and F. complanata showed levels of intermediate bleaching tolerance to elevated temperatures. However, the timing of Symbiodinium cell loss was similar between all corals tested. Mitotic indices and specific growth rates were found to be positively associated with increasing temperature; thus, symbiont reproduction increased despite elevated losses of Symbiodinium from the host. Because all corals in the present study were symbiotic with Symbiodinium from clade C, different levels of stress tolerance to temperature suggests that bleaching resistance is an attribute associated with the coral host and, to a lesser degree, the symbiont.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory has not explained how competition among lower level units is suppressed in the formation of higher-level evolutionary units. For example, the key problem of early evolution is small, individual replicators formed cooperative groups of sufficient complexity to allow accurate copying of the genetic material. The puzzle is why parasites did not subvert the formation of cells by obtaining benefits from the group without contributing to shared traits that enhance reproduction. These parasites would outcompete other replicators within the cell, disrupting reproductive fairness among subunits and destroying the functional coherence of the group. A similar problem arose at a later evolutionary stage with the orderly mendelian segregation of subunits (chromosomes) within cells, and reproductive fairness continued to be a problem in the evolution of insect and human societies. Here I present a simple model to show how reproductive fairness evolves among subunits to create functional coherence and higher-level units. Self-restraint, which evolves according to the kin-selection coefficient of relatedness, is not sufficient: mutual policing and enforcement of reproductive fairness are also required for the evolution of increasing social complexity.},

abstract = {The photosynthetic response to irradiance (PI response) of dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium was quantified immediately after isolation from symbiosis with 9 species of corals and allied taxa on Bermuda. Significant variation in PI parameters was identified among the algal isolates, but no consistent differences between representatives of different Symbiodinium phylotypes were obtained. In a parallel analysis of Montastraea franksi, a dominant Bermudian coral species, colonies from 4 to 16 m (all bearing Symbiodinium of Phylotype B) were acclimated to high light conditions. The photoacclimatory response was slight. It included an increase in the dark respiration rate by algae from all collection depths, increased light use efficiency and decreased saturating irradiance of algae from 4 m, and increased maximal photosynthetic rate per unit chlorophyll (chl), but not per cell, for algae from 8 and 16 m. We conclude that generalisations about differences between the photosynthetic traits between Symbiodinium phylotypes are not valid, and that the wide depth distribution of M. franksi cannot be attributed to either depth-dependent association with multiple Symbiodinium phylotypes with different photosynthetic properties or strong photoacclimatory capabilities of its complement of Symbiodinium. These data suggest that Symbiodinium phylotype is not generally an important determinant of the abundance and distribution of symbioses on coral reefs.},

abstract = {Symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria have in common that they live in or on host organisms or host cells. To make a successful living in eukaryotic hosts, bacteria must possess the traits to recognize a given host and establish adherence. When the bacterial location is internal or intracellular, they must further have the ability to invade, to establish a niche, and finally to multiply within a host. The underlying mechanisms which allow this form of existence show similarities between symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. The final outcome, however. may result in a wide spectrum of consequences for the host ranging from the acquisition of novel metabolic pathways to damage or death. Despite the vastly different forms of interactions, symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria have in common that they are adapted to a particular environmental niche represented by the host organism or compartment thereof. This contribution reviews the evolutionary forces which have shaped the microbial-host interactions. Particular emphasis is placed on the genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive bacterial evolution in response to the selective pressures of the host environment.},

abstract = {Mutualistic endosymbioses between two partners are complex associations that are regulated by the genetic interactions of the partners. One important marine symbiosis is that between various cnidarians, such as corals and anemones, and their photosynthetic algal symbionts. We have been interested in characterizing cnidarian host genes that are expressed as a function of the symbiotic state, using the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima as a model. In this study, we report on symbiosis-enhanced expression and synthesis of sym32 in anemones. We characterized the full-length sym32 cDNA, obtained by RT-PCR, and demonstrated, by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, that sym32 transcript was much more abundant in symbiotic than in non-symbiotic host anemone RNA. Further, using immunoblots, we determined that an antibody made to a sym32 fusion protein labeled a 32 kD band much more strongly in symbiotic compared to non-symbiotic anemone protein homogenates. Databank searches revealed that the sym32 deduced amino acid sequence shares significant homology with the fasciclin I (Fas I) Family of hemophilic cell adhesion proteins, present in a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. This strong homology with the Fas I family suggests that sym32 is involved in regulation of the symbiosis by mediating cell-cell interactions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Despite steep longitudinal and latitudinal gradients in total species richness, the composition of these key taxa is constrained within a remarkably narrow range of values. Regional-scale variation in reef biodiversity is best explained by large-scale patterns in the availability of shallow-water habitat. Once habitat area is accounted for, there is surprisingly little residual effect of latitude or longitude. Low-diversity regions are most vulnerable to human impacts such as global warming, underscoring the urgent need for integrated management at multinational scales.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are increasingly subject to a variety of threats from local to global scales. The development of monitoring and assessment tools to diagnose coral reef community responses to threats would assist greatly in management of their impacts. This paper examines interspecific patterns of bleaching, mortality, and recovery of corals on reefs in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique. and Madagascar for one year after the 1997-98 El Nino. On average, 50-80% bleaching and mortality of corals occurred throughout the region. Coral tissue condition (normal, pale, bleached, and dead) was recorded for up to I yr after the onset of bleaching, Thirteen coral species were used for analysis. Cluster Analysis and Principal Components Analysis with factor rotation were applied to the dataset, giving two major groups of species, characterized by (a) severe bleaching followed by 100% mortality (e.g., Acropora spp., Pocillopora spp., Galaxea astreata), (b) graduated bleaching with pale tissue and low-to-moderate mortality (e.g., Porites lutea, Echinopora gemmacea, Hydnophora exesa), and one outlier with long-term persistence of bleaching (Montipora tuberculosa). These species groups based on the bleaching response are consistent with life history strategies proposed by other workers. It is proposed that observations of coral condition and bleaching in the field, interpreted in the light of life history theory, can provide a coral bioassay technique for reef monitoring and management.},

abstract = {Coral reef communities are in it State of change throughout their geographical range. Factors contributing to this change include bleaching (the loss of algal symbionts), storm damage, disease, and increasing abundance of macroalgae. An additional factor for Caribbean reefs is the aftereffects of the epizootic that reduced the abundance of the herbivorous sea urchin, Diadema antillarum. Although coral reef communities have undergone phase shifts, there are few studies that document the details of such transitions. We report the results of a 40-month study that documents changes in a Caribbean reef community affected by bleaching, hurricane damage, and an increasing abundance of macroalgae. The study site was in a relatively pristine area of the reef surrounding the island of San Salvador in the Bahamas. Ten transects were sampled every 3-9 months from November 1994 to February 1998. During this period, the corals experienced a massive bleaching event resulting in a significant decline in coral abundance. Algae, especially macroalgae, increased in abundance until they effectively dominated the substrate. The direct impact of Hurricane Lili in October 1996 did not alter the developing community structure and may have facilitated increasing algal abundance. The results of this study document the rapid transition of this reef community from one in which corals and algae were codominant to a community dominated by macroalgae. The relatively brief time period required for this transition illustrates the dynamic: nature of reef communities.},

abstract = {In January 1994 a coral bleaching event occurred on the reefs of Magnetic Island (Australia) immediately after a period of anomalously high air temperatures. Average daily water temperature increased by 2 degrees C over 1 wk, reaching 34 degrees C (reef flat) and 32 degrees C (reef slope). Bleached corals were observed soon afterwards, suggesting the bleaching event was temperature related. Bleached (light tan coloured) and unbleached (dark brown coloured) colonies of staghorn coral Acropora formosa sampled during and after the bleaching event had lower zooxanthellar densities and higher chlorophyll a (chi a) concentrations per zooxanthella than the same colonies sampled 10 mo after the bleaching event. Significant increases in zooxanthellar chi a concentrations were measured in 2 colonies which were sampled and found to be losing zooxanthellae during the event. Intrinsic differences in the densities, chlorophyll concentrations and zooxanthellar cell sizes between neighbouring colonies of the same species resulted in intraspecific variability in coral discolouration during the bleaching event.},

abstract = {This review focuses on the biosynthesis of pigments in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and their physiological and regulatory functions in the context of information gathered from studies of other photosynthetic organisms. C. reinhardtii is serving as an important model organism for studies of photosynthesis and the pigments associated with the photosynthetic apparatus. Despite extensive information pertaining to the biosynthetic pathways critical for making chlorophylls and carotenoids, we are just beginning to understand the control of these pathways, the coordination between pigment and apoprotein synthesis, and the interactions between the activities of these pathways and those for other important cellular metabolites branching from these pathways. Other exciting areas relating to pigment function are also emerging: the role of intermediates of pigment biosynthesis as messengers that coordinate metabolism in the chloroplast with nuclear gene activity, and the identification of photoreceptors and their participation in critical cellular processes including phototaxis, gametogenesis, and the biogenesis of the photosynthetic machinery. These areas of research have become especially attractive for intensive development with the application of potent molecular and genomic tools currently being applied to studies of C. reinhardtii.},

The technique employed PCR in which one of the two primers used,fas fluorescently labeled at the 5' end and was used to amplify a selected region of bacterial genes encoding 16S rRNA from total community DNA. The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes, and the fluorescently labeled terminal restriction fragment was precisely measured by using an automated DNA sequencer, Computer-simulated analysis of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) for 1,002 eubacterial sequences showed that with proper selection of PCR primers and restriction enzymes, 686 sequences could be PCR amplified and classified into 233 unique terminal restriction fragment lengths or ''ribotypes,'' Using T-RFLP, we were able to distinguish all bacterial strains in a model bacterial community, and the pattern was consistent with the predicted outcome, Analysis of complex bacterial communities with T-RFLP revealed high species diversity in activated sludge, bioreactor sludge, aquifer sand, and termite guts; as many as 72 unique ribotypes were found in these communities, with 36 ribotypes observed in the termite guts, The community T-RFLP patterns were numerically analyzed and hierarchically clustered, The pattern derived from termite guts was found to be distinctly different from the patterns derived from the other three communities, Overall, our results demonstrated that T-RFLP is a powerful tool for assessing the diversity of complex bacterial communities and for rapidly comparing the community structure and diversity of different ecosystems.},

abstract = {All reef-forming corals depend on the photosynthesis performed by their algal symbiont, and such corals are therefore restricted to the photic zone. The intensity of light in this zone declines over several orders of magnitude-from high and damaging levels at the surface to extreme shade conditions at the lower limit(1). The ability of corals to tolerate this range implies effective mechanisms for light acclimation and adaptation(2). Here we show that the fluorescent pigments(3-9) (FPs) of corals provide a photobiological system for regulating the light environment of coral host tissue. Previous studies have suggested that under low light, FPs may enhance light availability(4,5). We now report that in excessive sunlight FPs are photoprotective; they achieve this by dissipating excess energy at wavelengths of low photosynthetic activity, as well as by reflecting of visible and infrared light by FP-containing chromatophores. We also show that FPs enhance the resistance to mass bleaching of corals during periods of heat stress, which has implications for the effect of environmental stress on the diversity of reef-building corals, such as enhanced survival of a broad range of corals allowing maintenance of habitat diversity.},

From 26 June 1992 to 2 July 1992, the water temperature remained low, at one point reaching 24.4 degree C. This was probably the result of the upward movement of a deep water thermocline to the sea surface. Coincident with this, Agaricia lamarcki, Agaricia fragilis, Eusmilia fastigiata, Diploria labyrinthiformis, Dichocoenia stokesi, Porites astreoides, Meandrina meandrites, Colpophyllia natans, and Siderastrea siderea showed minor bleaching of their tissue. Colonies of Montastrea annularis and Agaricia agaricites (both possibly species complexes) were greatly affected, with up to 84% of A. agaricites colonies at one point in the 7-day interval showing bleaching. The bleaching of A. agaricites was unusual because it appeared as thick white rings scattered over the colonies. In some cases the overlapping rings became so numerous that the colonies were fully bleached. The bleaching of corals in Bonaire (June 26-July 2, 1992) probably resulted from thermal shock caused by the rapidity of cooling combined with the reduction of water temperature to below the normal thermal tolerance of these corals. A comparison with the reefs and coral bleaching in the typically cooler northern waters of Bermuda suggests that in many cases it may not be the absolute water temperature (whether warm or cool) in itself that precipitates a bleaching reaction, but rather the rapidity of temperature change in combination with the deviation from the normal temperatures to which corals in a region are adapted.},

abstract = {Natural incidences of disease among scleractinian corals are unknown, since most studies have been initiated in response to specific disease outbreaks. Our ability to distinguish elevated disease incidences influenced by anthropogenic and climatic factors is limited since current estimates are probably inflated for extrapolation to larger areas. In our study, we used quantitative assessment methods to characterize the distribution and frequency of scleractinian and gorgonian coral diseases in the south Florida region. This paper is the first in a series that will detail different aspects of our studies. In this paper, we examined the strategy and methodology developed over 2 years to optimize the experimental design of our study, Pilot surveys were conducted in 1997 to develop and test methods, select and determine suitability of sites, and obtain preliminary data to assess the variance and efficiency of the sampling design. Survey periods targeted late spring, the time when coral diseases are believed to emerge, and late summer, the time when coral diseases are believed to be most prevalent, Two strata were chosen to evaluate patterns of coral disease: the first, geographic area, consisted of reefs in the vicinity of Key West, New Grounds and the Dry Tortugas; and the second, reef type, consisted of back, fore and transitional reefs, Random radial are transects (10 m diameter) were used to quantify 10 diseases affecting 18 species of stony corals and gorgonian sea fans over a large geographical region. During the pilot survey, we demonstrated that the outer 8-10 m segment (113 m 2) was an adequate sampling area. The survey implemented important quality assurance measures for data quality control. Power analysis determined that future studies should adopt alpha=0.10, beta=0.0383, and 1 - beta = 0.9617 in our experimental design. The highest prevalence of disease in our study was during the 1997 summer survey, with a mean percent coral disease (MPCD) of 28% occurring at Key West area reefs, or 55% of all back reef stations. Our results do not show a clear pattern of seasonality in coral diseases within either stratum, although differences in disease distribution between reef types and geographic areas were apparent in some of the spring and summer surveys.},

During multiple fission, the amoeba evacuated its food vacuoles and released the trapped and intact algae, which were then successfully cultured. This method of cleaning was especially useful with algal species that were sensitive to antibiotics or other germicidal agents.},

abstract = {The success of coral reefs is due to obligate mutualistic symbioses involving invertebrates and photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts belonging to the genus Symbiodinium. In the Caribbean, the vast majority of octocorals and other invertebrate hosts associate with Symbiodinium clade B, and more selectively, with a single lineage of this clade, Symbiodinium B1/B184. Although B1/B184 represents the most prevalent Symbiodinium in the Caribbean, there is little evidence supporting fine-scale diversity and host-alga specificity within this lineage. We explored simultaneously the questions of diversity and specificity in Symbiodinium B1/B184 by sequencing the flanking regions of two polymorphic microsatellites from a series of Symbiodinium clade B cultures along with Symbiodinium B1/B184 populations of the octocorals Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, P. bipinnata and Gorgonia ventalina. Seven unique sequence variants were identified based on concatenation of the two loci. Phylogenetic analyses of these variants, which we refer to as phylotypes, recognized five as belonging to B1/B184, thus providing the first evidence of distinct taxa within this Symbiodinium lineage. Furthermore, sympatric P. elisabethae and P. bipinnata at San Salvador in the Bahamas were found to harbour distinct Symbiodinium B1/B184 phylotypes, demonstrating unequivocally the existence of fine-scale specificity between Caribbean octocorals and these algae. Taken together, this study exemplifies the complex nature of Symbiodinium biodiversity and specificity.},

OjaCYP1A transcription decreased drastically on exposure to all heavy metals tested. OjaG6PD transcription increased dramatically after exposure to low doses of Cu and Zn, but decreased at high concentrations of these elements. No prominent changes in OjaG6PD transcription were observed after exposure to Ag, Cd, Cr, or Ni. OjaGPx mRNA expression was induced in the liver following exposure to Ag, Cd, Cu, and Zn, but suppressed following exposure to Cr and Ni. Exposure to all heavy metals increased transcription of OjaGR and OjaGST in a dose-dependent manner. OjaSOD transcription increased during exposure to Ag, Cd, Zn, and Cr, but showed no change in response to Cu and Ni exposure. OjaUB expression was induced by all doses of exposure. The transcriptional responses of these genes to heavy metal exposure will provide the basis for a multi-biomarker system that can be used for the biomonitoring of aquatic environments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Writing plays a central role in the communication of scientific ideas and is therefore a key aspect in researcher education, ultimately determining the success and long-term sustainability of their careers. Despite the growing popularity of e-learning, we are not aware of any existing study comparing on-line vs. traditional classroom-based methods for teaching scientific writing.

METHODS:Forty eight participants from a medical, nursing and physiotherapy background from US and Brazil were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 24 per group): An on-line writing workshop group (on-line group), in which participants used virtual communication, google docs and standard writing templates, and a standard writing guidance training (standard group) where participants received standard instruction without the aid of virtual communication and writing templates. Two outcomes, manuscript quality was assessed using the scores obtained in Six subgroup analysis scale as the primary outcome measure, and satisfaction scores with Likert scale were evaluated. To control for observer variability, inter-observer reliability was assessed using Fleiss's kappa. A post-hoc analysis comparing rates of communication between mentors and participants was performed. Nonparametric tests were used to assess intervention efficacy.

RESULTS:Excellent inter-observer reliability among three reviewers was found, with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) agreement = 0.931882 and ICC consistency = 0.932485. On-line group had better overall manuscript quality (p = 0.0017, SSQSavg score 75.3 +/- 14.21, ranging from 37 to 94) compared to the standard group (47.27 +/- 14.64, ranging from 20 to 72). Participant satisfaction was higher in the on-line group (4.3 +/- 0.73) compared to the standard group (3.09 +/- 1.11) (p = 0.001). The standard group also had fewer communication events compared to the on-line group (0.91 +/- 0.81 vs. 2.05 +/- 1.23; p = 0.0219).

CONCLUSION:Our protocol for on-line scientific writing instruction is better than standard face-to-face instruction in terms of writing quality and student satisfaction. Future studies should evaluate the protocol efficacy in larger longitudinal cohorts involving participants from different languages.},

Here we characterize the first coral heat shock protein 70 gene (SP-HSP70), cloned from S. pistillata, to be used as a tool for studying coral stress response. The cloning was carried out by a combination of PCR methods using heterologous, degenerate HSP70-based primers, followed by plaque-lift screening of a genomic library. The sequenced clone (5212 bp), contains a complete 1953 bp, intronless open reading frame, and 5' and 3' flanking regions of 1,935 and 1,324 bp, respectively. TATA, CAAT, and ATF boxes as well as 11 putative heat shock elements were identified in the SP-HSP70 5' flanking region. A polyadenylation site was identified in the 3' flanking region. SP-HSP70 protein sequence resembles the cytosolic/nuclear HSP70 cluster. RT-PCR studies confirmed SP-HSP70 mRNA expression in corals grown within their normal physiological conditions. Furthermore, SP-HSP70 has been shown to belong to the coral genome and not to its symbiotic algae one, as revealed by SP-HSP70 PCR amplification, using purified algal and coral DNA templates.

abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

abstract = {Associations were examined between warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies (mostly associated with the occurrence of warm El Nino-Southern Oscillation events) and coral bleaching in Academy Bay, Galapagos Is. and Naos Is., Gulf of Panama, in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. Various SST-related metrics potentially associated with bleaching occurrence were computed. These quantities suggested that the 1997-98 event, considered one of the strongest in recent history, was comparable in intensity to the strong 1982-83 event for the regions studied. Previously established 'bleaching conditions' (function of maximum annual SST values and a degree-days index) were shown to be valid for the 1997-98 ENSO event. In Galapagos, the 1997-98 metrics fell within the previously identified 'bleaching conditions' and bleaching indeed was observed (although not so severe as earlier and populations subsequently recovered). In the Gulf of Panama, the metrics' values were outside the range of bleaching conditions and no bleaching was detected. Lower coral mortality in Galapagos in 1997-98 may have been due in part to the timing of largest SST anomalies and to SST fluctuations in early 1998. Additionally, since current coral populations in the Galapagos have originated from coral survivors and their progeny following the 1982-83 disturbance, the presently-ob served lower mortality rates may also have resulted from host/symbiont combinations more resistant to high temperatures.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the design of a controller that maximizes the biomass production in an artificially lighted photobioreactor operated in batch mode, by maintaining the ratio between the incident light intensity and the biomass concentration (light-to-microalgae ratio) at targeted light regime. The controller acts on the incident light intensity applied on the photobioreactor surface. First, the optimal ratio trajectory is determined and then the obtained optimal trajectory is tracked using a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control law. The proposed control strategy performances were illustrated and assessed in simulation for a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii batch culture.},

abstract = {We develop an approach for studying population dynamics resulting from mutualism by employing functional responses based on density-dependent benefits and costs. These functional responses express how the population growth rate of a mutualist is modified by the density of its partner. We present several possible dependencies of gross benefits and costs, and hence net effects, to a mutualist as functions of the density of its partner. Net effects to mutualists are likely a monotonically saturating or unimodal function of the density of their partner. We show that fundamental differences in the growth, limitation, and dynamics of a population can occur when net effects to that population change linearly, unimodally, or in a saturating fashion. We use the mutualism between senita cactus and its pollinating seed-eating moth as an example to show the influence of different benefit and cost functional responses on population dynamics and stability of mutualisms. We investigated two mechanisms that may alter this mutualism's functional responses: distribution of eggs among flowers and fruit abortion. Differences in how benefits and costs vary with density can alter the stability of this mutualism. In particular, fruit abortion may allow for a stable equilibrium where none could otherwise exist.},

abstract = {Some authors argue that overfishing is an important reason that reef corals have declined in recent decades. Their reasoning is that overfishing removes herbivores, releasing macroalgae to overgrow and kill the corals. The evidence suggests, however, that global climate change and emergent marine diseases make a far greater contribution to coral mortality, and that macroalgae generally grow on the exposed skeletal surfaces of corals that are already dead. Macroalgal dominance, therefore, is an effect rather than a cause of coral mortality. Marine protected areas (MPAs), which are usually established to protect stocks of reef fish, foster populations of herbivorous fish under at least some circumstances. Increased herbivory can reduce algal cover, potentially accelerating the recovery of coral populations inside MPAs; however, establishing MPAs will have only a limited impact on coral recovery unless policymakers confront the accelerating negative effects of the global-scale sources of coral mortality.},

abstract = {Over the past 40 years, coral cover has reduced by as much as 80%. At the same time, Coral Reefs are coming under increasing threat from hurricanes, as climate change is expected to increase the intensity of hurricanes. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to understand the effect of hurricanes on a coral population. This Thesis focuses on the reef-building coral Montastraea annularis. This species once dominated Caribbean Coral Reefs, but is fast being replaced by faster growing more opportunistic species. It is important that the underlying dynamics of the decline is understood, if managers stand any chance of reversing this decline. The aim of this Thesis is to investigate the effect of hurricane activity on the dynamics of the reef-building coral Montastraea annularis. To achieve this the Integral Projection Model (IPM) method was adopted and the results compared to those produced using the more traditional method of Population Projection Matrix (PPM) method. The models were fitted using census data from June 1998 to January 2003, which described the area of individual coral patches on a sample of ramets on Glovers Reef, Belize. Glovers Reef is a marine reserve that lies 30km off the coast of Belize and 15km east of the main barrier reef. Three hurricanes struck Glovers Reef during the study: Hurricane Mitch (October 1998), Hurricane Keith (September 2000) and Hurricane Iris (October 2001). The data have been divided by two different methods in order to test two research questions, firstly if the initial trauma following a hurricane affects the long term dynamics of a population and, secondly, if the dynamics exhibited during a hurricane varied with hurricane strength. In this Thesis five main results are shown: 1. All models for all divisions of data are in long term decline. 2. As initial trauma increased, the long term growth rates decreased, conversely the short term extremes increased. 3. Fragmentation is more likely as patch size increased and more likely under stronger hurricanes. 4. Integral Projection Modelling painted a similar picture to Population Projection Matrix models and should be a preferred method of analysis.5. Interaction of the IPMs can be used to model the changing occurrence of hurricanes under climate change. It is shown that with increased intensity, the population could become extinct 6.3 years sooner. This research is the first step in modelling coral patch populations by the IPM method. It suggests possible functional forms and compares the results with the PPM method. Further research is required into the biological functions which drive fragmentation, the method by which large patches divide into groups of smaller patches. The conclusions from this Thesis add to the growing body of knowledge concerning the response of coral species to hurricanes, focusing on the importance of understanding patch dynamics, in order to understand colonial dynamics.},

Here we report 11 new members of the family, among which there are 3 red-emitters possessing unusual features, and discuss the similarity relationships within the family in structural, spectroscopic, and evolutionary terms. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that GFP-like proteins from representatives of subclass Zoantharia fall into at least four distinct clades, each clade containing proteins of more than one emission color. This topology suggests multiple recent events of color conversion. Combining this result with previous mutagenesis and structural data, we propose that (Q different chromophore structures are alternative products synthesized within a similar autocatalytic environment, and (ii) the phylogenetic pattern and color diversity in reef Anthozoa is a result of a balance between selection for GFP-like proteins of particular colors and mutation pressure driving the color conversions.},

abstract = {Growing concerns over ocean acidification have highlighted the need to critically understand inorganic carbon acquisition and utilization in marine microalgae. Here, we contrast these characteristics for the first time between two genetically distinct dinoflagellate species of the genus Symbiodinium (phylotypes A13 and A20) that live in symbiosis with reef-forming corals. Both phylotypes were grown in continuous cultures under identical environmental conditions. Rubisco was measured using quantitative Western blots, and radioisotopic (14) C uptake was used to characterize light- and total carbon dioxide (TCO2 )-dependent carbon fixation, as well as inorganic carbon species preference and external carbonic anhydrase activity. A13 and A20 exhibited similar rates of carbon fixation despite cellular concentrations of Rubisco being approximately four-fold greater in A13. The uptake of CO2 over HCO3 - was found to support the majority of carbon fixation in both phylotypes. However, A20 was also able to indirectly utilize HCO3 - by first converting it to CO2 via external carbonic anhydrase. These results show that adaptive differences in inorganic carbon acquisition have evolved within the Symbiodinium genus, which thus carries fundamental implications as to how this functionally key genus will respond to ocean acidification, but could also represent a key trait factor that influences their productivity when in hospite of their coral hosts.},

Despite the majority of lost Symbiodinium cells being viable at 28 degreesC, the predominance of apoptotic and necrotic symbiont cells at higher temperatures indicates that the proportion of live cells decreases with increasing temperature. This implies that reinfection of corals at high temperatures by Symbiodinium lost from scleractinian corals may be less frequent than previously described, since many of the symbiont cells exhibit nonreversible symptoms of approaching cell death. The fraction of viable Symbiodinium cells lost from S. ehrenbergi, Xenia sp., and Sinularia at 32 degreesC was greater than that at 28 degreesC. At 34 degreesC, the fraction of viable cells lost from S. ehrenbergi and Xenia sp. fell but not from Sinularia sp., which suggests that their symbionts have higher temperature tolerances. Thus, Symbiodinium from octocorals may represent "pools" of genetically resistant symbionts available for reinfection of other reef organisms. This has been proposed previously for Symbiodinium in some scleractinian corals, but this is the first evidence for such, particularly for an octocoral. Many of the viable cells, determined using Trypan blue staining techniques, are in fact actually undergoing apoptosis or necrosis, when examined using Annexin V-fluor and propidium iodide staining profiles. The characterization of more apoptotic and necrotic cells than viable cells is critical, as this indicates that the loss of Symbiodinium cells cannot be beneficial to other bleached corals for symbiotic reassociation.

abstract = {Wave lensing produces the highest level of transient solar irradiances found in nature, ranging in intensity over several orders of magnitude in just a few tens of milliseconds. Shallow coral reefs can be exposed to wave lensing during light-wind, clear-sky conditions, which have been implicated as a secondary cause of mass coral bleaching through light stress. Management strategies to protect small areas of high-value reef from wave-lensed light stress were tested using seawater irrigation sprinklers to negate wave lensing by breaking up the water surface. A series of field and tank experiments investigated the physical and photophysiological response of the shallow-water species Stylophora pistillata and Favites abdita to wave lensing and sprinkler conditions. Results show that the sprinkler treatment only slightly reduces the total downwelling photosynthetically active and ultraviolet irradiance (∼5.0%), whereas it dramatically reduces, by 460%, the irradiance variability caused by wave lensing. Despite this large reduction in variability and modest reduction in downwelling irradiance, there was no detectable difference in photophysiological response of the corals between control and sprinkler treatments under two thermal regimes of ambient (27{\textdegree}C) and heated treatment (31{\textdegree}C). This study suggests that shallow-water coral species are not negatively affected by the strong flashes that occur under wave-lensing conditions.},

abstract = {Climate change is a major threat to coral reef ecosystems worldwide. A key determinant of the fate of reef corals in a warming climate is their capacity to tolerate increasing thermal stress. Here, an increase in thermal tolerance is demonstrated for three major coral genera (Acropora, Pocillopora and Porites) following the extensive mass bleaching event that occurred on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) in 1998. During the subsequent and more severe thermal stress event in 2002, bleaching severity was 30-100% lower than predicted from the relationship between severity and thermal stress in 1998, despite higher solar irradiances during the 2002 thermal event. Coral genera most susceptible to thermal stress (Pocillopora and Acropora) showed the greatest increase in tolerance. Although bleaching was severe in 1998, whole-colony mortality was low at most study sites. Therefore, observed increases in thermal tolerance cannot be explained by selective mortality alone, suggesting a capacity for acclimatization or adaptation. Although the vulnerability of coral reefs remains largely dependent on the rate and extent of climate change, such increase in thermal tolerance may delay the onset of mass coral mortalities in time for the implementation of low-emission scenarios and effective management.},

To evaluate changes in fluorescence during long-term bleaching and recovery, Porites compressa and Montipora capitata corals were experimentally bleached in tanks at 30 degrees C for 1 month, while control fragments were maintained at 27 degrees C. A pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer measured the quantum yield of photosystem II fluorescence (Fv/Fm) of the zooxanthellae each week during bleaching, and after 0, 1.5, 4 and 8 months recovery. M. capitata appeared bleached 6 days sooner than P. compressa, yet their fluorescence patterns during bleaching did not significantly differ. Changes in minimum (Fo), maximum (Fm) and variable (Fv) fluorescence throughout bleaching and recovery indicated periods of initial photoprotection followed by photodamage in both species, with P. compressa requiring less time for photosystem II (PS II) repair than M. capitata. Fv/Fm fully recovered 6.5 months earlier in P. compressa than M. capitata, suggesting that the zooxanthellae of P. compressa were more resilient to bleaching stress.},

Most zooxanthellae have been placed in the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium as one or several species that are not easily distinguished. We compared Symbiodinium and nonsymbiotic dinoflagellates using small ribosomal subunit RNA sequences. Surprisingly, small ribosomal subunit RNA diversity within the genus Symbiodinium is comparable to that observed among different orders of nonsymbiotic dinoflagellates. These data reinforce the conclusion that Symbiodinium-like zooxanthellae represent a collection of distinct species and provide a precedent for a molecular genetic taxonomy of the genus Symbiodinium.},

abstract = {High-throughput direct sequencing techniques have recently opened the possibility to sequence genomes from Pleistocene organisms. Here we analyze DNA sequences determined from a Neandertal, a mammoth, and a cave bear. We show that purines are overrepresented at positions adjacent to the breaks in the ancient DNA, suggesting that depurination has contributed to its degradation. We furthermore show that substitutions resulting from miscoding cytosine residues are vastly overrepresented in the DNA sequences and drastically clustered in the ends of the molecules, whereas other substitutions are rare. We present a model where the observed substitution patterns are used to estimate the rate of deamination of cytosine residues in single- and double-stranded portions of the DNA, the length of single-stranded ends, and the frequency of nicks. The results suggest that reliable genome sequences can be obtained from Pleistocene organisms.},

abstract = {Many natural communities exhibit positive relationships between local and regional species richness (LSR{\textendash}RSR relationships), which can be either linear or curvilinear. Previous models have shown that the form of this relationship depends on the relative rates of colonization and extinction and the sensitivity of these rates to competition. We use simple models to show that the LSR{\textendash}RSR relationship also depends on the type of metacommunity structure (Levins-like or mainland{\textendash}island), and our models generate a wider range of realistic forms than do most previous models. We parameterize and test our models with two independent data sets for Daphnia in rock pools on islands in Finland and Sweden. We find that the Levins-like model with competition correctly predicts the observed LSR{\textendash}RSR relationship and provides the best fit to the average local species richness per island. Simulations show that our models are robust to relaxing our assumption of identical species properties. Our study is one of the first to m...},

abstract = {The "symbiosome membrane" as defined by Roth et al. (1988) is a single, host-derived membrane that surrounds an endosymbiotic organism, separating it from the cytoplasm of the host cell. However, in the case of cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbioses, clear identification of the symbiosome membrane is complicated by the fact that each algal symbiont is surrounded by multiple layers of apparent membrane. The origin and molecular nature of these membranes has been the subject of considerable debate in the literature. Here we report the development of host-specific (G12) and symbiont-specific (PC3) monoclonal antibodies that allow separation of the host and symbiont components of these multiple membranes. Using immunocytochemistry at both the light and the electron microscopic level, we present data supporting the conclusion that the definitive symbiosome membrane is a single, host-derived membrane, whereas the remainder of the underlying apparent membranes surrounding the algal cell are symbiont-derived, The potential for macromolecules associated with these membranes to act as cellular signals critical to recruiting symbionts and maintaining established symbioses is discussed.},

abstract = {The temperate sea anemone Anemonia viridis (Forskal) forms an endosymbiotic association with dinoflagellate algae commonly referred to as zooxanthellae. It is now well established that under appropriate environmental conditions, these associations can be autotrophic for carbon. Under such conditions, many of these Symbioses, including A. viridis, not only retain excretory ammonium, but can take up ammonium added to the surrounding seawater. The flux from inorganic to organic nitrogen will be via the free amino acid pools and in A. viridis these were found to be markedly different between zooxanthellae and host with glycine and taurine dominant in the latter. When anemones were maintained with 20 muM ammonium, the concentration of free amino groups increased in the zooxanthellae but appeared not to change in the host. There was no evidence that the ratio of glutamine glutamate in zooxanthellae changed when anemones were maintained with 20 muM ammonium for 47 days. These ratios imply that zooxanthellae from this temperate symbiosis may not be nitrogen-limited. GDH was detected in both zooxanthellae and host where it was most active with the coenzyme NADPH. In addition, GDH showed activity when glutamine replaced ammonium as the substrate, indicating that (lie host may have alternative means to assimilate ammonium. Zooxanthellae were shown to possess GOGAT activity in the presence of a ferredoxin analogue. This suggests that in vivo zooxanthellae could assimilate ammonium via the activity of GS linked with ferredoxin-dependent GOGAT, Given evidence from other studies of rapid ammonium assimilation and essential amino acid synthesis in symbiotic host tissue, it appears that the capacity of cnidarians to metabolise nitrogen may at present be underestimated.},

abstract = {Diversity measurement is important for understanding community structure and dynamics, but has been particularly challenging for microorganisms. Microbial community characterization using small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences has revealed an extensive, previously unsuspected diversity that we are only now beginning to understand, especially now that advanced sequencing technologies are producing datasets containing hundreds of thousands of sequences from hundreds of samples. Efforts to quantify microbial diversity often use taxon-based methods that ignore the fact that not all species are equally related, which can therefore obscure important patterns in the data. For example, alpha-diversity (diversity within communities) is often estimated as the number of species in a community (species richness), and beta-diversity (partitioning of diversity among communities) is often based on the number of shared species. Methods for measuring alpha- and beta-diversity that account for different levels of divergence between individuals have recently been more widely applied. These methods are more powerful than taxon-based methods because microorganisms in a community differ dramatically in sequence similarity, which also often correlates with phenotypic similarity in key features such as metabolic capabilities. Consequently, divergence-based methods are providing new insights into microbial community structure and function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Mass coral bleaching is increasing in scale and frequency across the world's coral reefs and is being driven primarily by increased levels of thermal stress arising from global warming. In order to understand the impacts of projected climate change upon corals reefs, it is important to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms that operate during coral bleaching and subsequent mortality. In this respect, increased apoptotic cell death activity is an important cellular process that is associated with the breakdown of the mutualistic symbiosis between the cnidarian host and their dinoflagellate symbionts.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:The PRESENT study reports the impacts of different stressors (colchicine and heat stress) on three phases of apoptosis: (i) the potential initiation by differential expression of Bcl-2 members, (ii) the execution of apoptotic events by activation of caspase 3-like proteases and (iii) and finally, the cell disposal indicated by DNA fragmentation in the reef building coral Acropora millepora. In corals incubated with colchicine, an increase in caspase 3-like activity and DNA fragmentation was associated with a relative down-regulation of Bcl-2, suggesting that the initiation of apoptosis may be mediated by the suppression of an anti-apoptotic mechanism. In contrast, in the early steps of heat stress, the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis was related to a relative up-regulation of Bcl-2 consecutively followed by a delayed decrease in apoptosis activity.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:In the light of these results, we propose a model of heat stress in coral hosts whereby increasing temperatures engage activation of caspase 3-dependent apoptosis in cells designated for termination, but also the onset of a delayed protective response involving overexpression of Bcl-2 in surviving cells. This mitigating response to thermal stress could conceivably be an important regulatory mechanism for cell survival in corals exposed to sudden environmental changes.},

abstract = {Bacteria are abundant in the atmosphere, where they often represent a major portion of the organic aerosols. Potential pathogens of plants and livestock are commonly dispersed through the atmosphere, and airborne bacteria can have important effects on human health as pathogens or triggers of allergic asthma and seasonal allergies. Despite their importance, the diversity and biogeography of airborne microorganisms remain poorly understood. We used high-throughput pyrosequencing to analyze bacterial communities present in the aerosol fraction containing fine particulate matter of $\le$2.5 $\mu$m from 96 near-surface atmospheric samples collected from cities throughout the midwestern United States and found that the communities are surprisingly diverse and strongly affected by the season. We also directly compared the airborne communities to those found in hundreds of samples representing potential source environments. We show that, in addition to the more predictable sources (soils and leaf surfaces), fecal material, most likely dog feces, often represents an unexpected source of bacteria in the atmosphere at more urbanized locations during the winter. Airborne bacteria are clearly an important, but understudied, component of air quality that needs to be better integrated into efforts to measure and model pollutants in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The sources and mechanisms of inorganic carbon transport for scleractinian coral calcification and photosynthesis were studied using a double labelling technique with H(14)CO(3) and (45)Ca. Clones of Stylophora pistillata that had developed into microcolonies were examined. Compartmental and pharmacological analyses of the distribution of(45)Ca and H(14)CO(3) in the coelenteron, tissues and skeleton were performed in dark or light conditions or in the presence of various seawater HCO(3)(-) concentrations. For calcification, irrespective of the lighting conditions, the major source of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is metabolic CO(2) (70-75% of total CaCO(3) deposition), while only 25-30% originates from the external medium (seawater carbon pool). These results are in agreement with the observation that metabolic CO(2) production in the light is at least six times greater than is required for calcification. This source is dependent on carbonic anhydrase activity because it is sensitive to ethoxyzolamide. Seawater DIC is transferred from the external medium to the coral skeleton by two different pathways: from sea water to the coelenteron, the passive paracellular pathway is largely sufficient, while a DIDS-sensitive transcellular pathway appears to mediate the flux across calicoblastic cells. Irrespective of the source, an anion exchanger performs the secretion of DIC at the site of calcification. Furthermore, a fourfold light-enhanced calcification of Stylophora pistillata microcolonies was measured. This stimulation was only effective after a lag of 10 min. These results are discussed in the context of light-enhanced calcification. Characterisation of the DIC supply for symbiotic dinoflagellate photosynthesis demonstrated the presence of a DIC pool within the tissues. The size of this pool was dependent on the lighting conditions, since it increased 39-fold after 3 h of illumination. Passive DIC equilibration through oral tissues between sea water and the coelenteric cavity is insufficient to supply this DIC pool, suggesting that there is an active transepithelial absorption of inorganic carbon sensitive to DIDS, ethoxyzolamide and iodide. These results confirm the presence of CO(2)-concentrating mechanisms in coral cells. The tissue pool is not, however, used as a source for calcification since no significant lag phase in the incorporation of external seawater DIC was measured.},

Most phylogenetic studies of Symbiodinium have used nuclear rRNA (nrDNA) genes to infer relationships among members of the genus. In this report, we present the first phylogeny of Symbiodinium based on DNA sequences from a mitochondrial protein-coding gene (cytochrome oxidase subunit I [cox1]). Two principal groups, one comprised of Symbiodinium clade A and the second encompassing Symbiodinium clades B/C/D/E/F, are strongly supported in the cox1 phylogeny. Relationships within Symbiodinium clades B/C/D/E/F, however, are less well resolved compared with phylogenies inferred from nrDNA and chloroplast large subunit (cp23S)-rDNA genes. Statistical tests between alternative tree topologies verified, with an exception being the position of one controversial member of Symbiodinium clade D, that relationships inferred from cox1 are congruent with those inferred from nrDNA and cp23S-rDNA. Taken together, the relationships between the major Symbiodinium clades are robust, and there appears to be no evidence of hybridization or differential introgression of nuclear and plastid genomes between clades.},

abstract = {The evolutionary success of reef-building corals in nutrient-poor tropical waters is attributed to endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. The algae release photosynthetic products to the coral animal cells, augment nutrient flux, and enhance the rate of coral calcification. Natural abundance of stable isotopes (delta13C and delta18O) provides answers to modern and paleobiological questions about the effect of photosymbiosis on sources of carbon and oxygen in coral skeletal calcium carbonate. Here we compare 17 species of symbiotic and nonsymbiotic corals to determine whether evidence for photosymbiosis appears in stable isotopes (delta13C and delta15N) of an organic skeletal compartment, the coral skeletal organic matrix (OM). Mean OM delta13C in symbiotic and nonsymbiotic corals was similar (-26.08 per thousand vs. -24.31 per thousand), but mean OM delta15N was significantly depleted in 15N in the former (4.09 per thousand) relative to the latter (12.28 per thousand), indicating an effect of the algae on OM synthesis and revealing OM delta15N as a proxy for photosymbiosis. To answer an important paleobiological question about the origin of photosymbiosis in reef-building corals, we applied this proxy test to a fossil coral (Pachythecalis major) from the Triassic (240 million years ago) in which OM is preserved. Mean OM delta15N was 4.66 per thousand, suggesting that P. major was photosymbiotic. The results show that symbiotic algae augment coral calcification by contributing to the synthesis of skeletal OM and that they may have done so as early as the Triassic.},

abstract = {The role of reactive oxygen species, with the subsequent oxidative deterioration of biological macromolecules in the toxicities associated with transition metal ions, is reviewed. Recent studies have shown that metals, including iron, copper, chromium, and vanadium undergo redox cycling, while cadmium, mercury, and nickel, as well as lead, deplete glutathione and protein-bound sulfhydryl groups, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species as superoxide ion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical. As a consequence, enhanced lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and altered calcium and sulfhydryl homeostasis occur. Fenton-like reactions may be commonly associated with most membranous fractions including mitochondria, microsomes, and peroxisomes. Phagocytic cells may be another important source of reactive oxygen species in response to metal ions. Furthermore, various studies have suggested that the ability to generate reactive oxygen species by redox cycling quinones and related compounds may require metal ions. Recent studies have suggested that metal ions may enhance the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and activate protein kinase C, as well as induce the production of stress proteins. Thus, some mechanisms associated with the toxicities of metal ions are Very similar to the effects produced by many organic xenobiotics. Specific differences in the toxicities of metal ions may be related to differences in solubilities, absorbability, transport, chemical reactivity, and the complexes that are formed within the body. This review summarizes current studies that have been conducted with transition metal ions as well as lead, regarding the production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative tissue damage.},

abstract = {Climate change is reshaping biological communities and has already generated novel ecosystems. The functioning of novel ecosystems could depart markedly from that of existing systems and therefore obscure the impacts of climate change. We illustrate this possibility for coral reefs, which are at the forefront of climatic stress. Disease has been a principal cause of reef degradation and is expected to worsen with increased future thermal stress. However, using a field-tested epizoological model, we show that high population turnover within novel ecosystems enhances coral resistance to epizootics. Thus, disease could become a less important driver of change in the future. We emphasize the need to move away from projections based on historic trends toward predictions that account for novel behavior of ecosystems under climate change.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic activities of hermatypic corals (28 genera, c. 68 species and c. 92 specimen) were measured in November 2000 at Sekisei lagoon, Okinawa, Japan, using an underwater pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer. Maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) ranged from 0.61 to 0.70 and had an average value of 0.664 (standard deviation [SD], 0.0289). Following the measurement of Fv/Fm, quantum yield (Fm'-F)/Fm' at eight-leveled actinic-light intensities were obtained from all specimens. Values of electronic transport rates (ETR) were nearly the same under low photosynthetic active radiation (PAR; mu mol quanta/m(2) per s) condition and varied with increasing PAR. The value of ETR at 100 pmol quanta/m(2) per s ranged from 21.3 to 30.0 and had an average of 27.8 (SD, 2.09). In August 2001, a coral bleaching event was observed in Sekisei Lagoon. During the event, photosynthetic activities of 21 specimens of eight species (seven genera) were measured. By applying two indicators, Fv/Fm and ETR at 100 pmol quanta/m2 per s obtained in August 2000, 18 of 21 specimens were suggested under the bleaching process. In case of Porites lutea, seven colonies were visually evaluated for their condition of bleaching and were found to have two `normal', three `slightly bleached' and two `heavily bleached'. From the density of zooxanthellae, colonies evaluated `normal' or 'slightly bleached' did not show an apparent difference. However, they were clearly identified by Fm/Fv and ETR at 100 mu mol quanta/m(2) per s.},

abstract = {The 450-million-year-old symbiosis between the majority of land plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is one of the most ancient, abundant, and ecologically important mutualisms on Earth. Yet, the evolutionary stability of mycorrhizal associations is still poorly understood, as it follows none of the constraints thought to stabilize cooperation in other well-known mutualisms. The capacity of both host and symbiont to simultaneously interact with several partners introduces a unique dilemma; detecting and punishing those exploiting the mutualism becomes increasingly difficult if these individuals can continue to access resources from alternative sources. Here, we explore four hypotheses to explain evolutionary cooperation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis: (1) pseudo-vertical transmission and spatial structuring of plant and fungal populations leading to local adaptation of partners; (2) luxury resource exchange in which plants trade surplus carbon for excess fungal nutrients; (3) partner choice allowing partners to associate with better cooperators; and (4) host and symbiont sanctions which actively reward good partners and punish less cooperative ones. We propose that mycorrhizal cooperation is promoted by an exchange of surplus resources between partners and enforced through sanctions by one or both partners. These mechanisms may allow plant and fungal genotypes to discriminate against individuals employing exploitative strategies, promoting patterns of partner choice. Together these selection pressures provide a framework for understanding the stabilization of mycorrhizal cooperation over evolutionary time.},

abstract = {Several reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously produced in plants as byproducts of aerobic metabolism. Depending on the nature of the ROS species, some are highly toxic and rapidly detoxified by various cellular enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms. Whereas plants are surfeited with mechanisms to combat increased ROS levels during abiotic stress conditions, in other circumstances plants appear to purposefully generate ROS as signaling molecules to control various processes including pathogen defense, programmed cell death, and stomatal behavior. This review describes the mechanisms of ROS generation and removal in plants during development and under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. New insights into the complexity and roles that ROS play in plants have come from genetic analyses of ROS detoxifying and signaling mutants. Considering recent ROS-induced genome-wide expression analyses, the possible functions and mechanisms for ROS sensing and signaling in plants are compared with those in animals and yeast.},

abstract = {A moderate increase in seawater temperature causes coral bleaching, at least partially through photobleaching of the symbiotic algae Symbiodinium spp. Photobleaching of Symbiodinium spp. is primarily associated with the loss of light-harvesting proteins of photosystem II (PSII) and follows the inactivation of PSII under heat stress. Here, we examined the effect of increased growth temperature on the change in sensitivity of Symbiodinium spp. PSII inactivation and photobleaching under heat stress. When Symbiodinium spp. cells were grown at 25{\textdegree}C and 30{\textdegree}C, the thermal tolerance of PSII, measured by the thermal stability of the maximum quantum yield of PSII in darkness, was commonly enhanced in all six Symbiodinium spp. tested. In Symbiodinium sp. CCMP827, it took 6 h to acquire the maximum PSII thermal tolerance after transfer from 25{\textdegree}C to 30{\textdegree}C. The effect of increased growth temperature on the thermal tolerance of PSII was completely abolished by chloramphenicol, indicating that the acclimation mechanism of PSII is associated with the de novo synthesis of proteins. When CCMP827 cells were exposed to light at temperature ranging from 25{\textdegree}C to 35{\textdegree}C, the sensitivity of cells to both high temperature-induced photoinhibition and photobleaching was ameliorated by increased growth temperatures. These results demonstrate that thermal acclimation of Symbiodinium spp. helps to improve the thermal tolerance of PSII, resulting in reduced inactivation of PSII and algal photobleaching. These results suggest that whole-organism coral bleaching associated with algal photobleaching can be at least partially suppressed by the thermal acclimation of Symbiodinium spp. at higher growth temperatures.},

abstract = {Branch tips from colonies of a staghorn coral Acropora formosa were exposed to elevated concentrations of copper in order to examine the potential of the 'bleaching' response as a means of assessing stress in corals. Two identical toxicity tests were conducted over 48 h using 2 colonies with naturally different algal (zooxanthellae) densities. The tips from both colonies bleached in proportion to the copper concentrations, through loss of zooxanthellae to the surrounding water. A higher incidence of mortality was observed in tips from the colony with fewer zooxanthellae. During the tests, control corals lost zooxanthellae at a rate of <1% of the algal standing stock d(-1), zooxanthellae release from both control and experimental corals occurred 2x faster during the daytime than night time, and the number of zooxanthellae appearing as doublets (the mitotic index) was 5 to 8x higher in zooxanthellae released from the corals' tips than inside the tips (in hospite) at the end of the experiment. The implications of these findings for future toxicity tests using the bleaching response, and for using changes in the number of zooxanthellae appearing as doublets to assess stress are discussed. Results suggest (1) that loss of zooxanthellae can be used within the framework of a standardised laboratory-based bioassay with universal integrity for assessing stress in zooxanthellate corals, and (2) that inherent differences in the densities of zooxanthellae between coral colonies are Likely to affect the outcome of experiments using the bleaching response and of other biochemical or physiological stress responses.},

abstract = {In this study, we report evidence that temperature plays a key role in determining the relative abundance of two mutualistic fungi associated with an economically and ecologically important bark beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae. The symbiotic fungi possess different optimal temperature ranges. These differences determine which fungus is vectored by dispersing host beetles as temperatures fluctuate over a season. Grosmannia clavigera is the predominant fungus carried by dispersing beetles during cool periods but decreases in prevalence as daily maximum temperatures approach 25 degrees C, and becomes extremely rare when temperatures reach or exceed 32 degrees C. In contrast, Ophiostoma montium increases in prevalence as temperatures approach 25 degrees C, and becomes the predominant symbiont dispersed when temperatures reach or exceed 32 degrees C. The possession of different optimal growth temperatures may facilitate the stable coexistence of the two fungi by supporting growth of each fungus at different times, minimizing direct competition. Furthermore, the beetle may reduce its risk of being left aposymbiotic by exploiting not one, but two symbionts, whose combined growth optima span a wide range of environmental conditions. The possession of multiple symbionts with different temperature tolerances may allow the beetle to occupy highly variable habitats over a wide geographic range. Such temperature-driven symbiont shifts are likely to have major consequences for both the host and its symbionts under current temperature regimes and those predicted to occur because of climate change.},

One of the data sets was obtained by sampling reef flat colonies. A second data set was obtained by sampling colonies maintained in outdoor laboratory tanks continuously supplied with sea water (laboratory controls) and a third set was maintained in similar tanks which were continuously supplied with ammonium enriched sea water. The set of nutrient-enriched corals showed higher algal densities than the control corals. Comparison of the annual pattern in these three sets with environmental variables suggests the pattern may be in response to seasonal differences in insolation, either Visible or UV.

abstract = {The Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean) experienced warm summers in 1998, 1999 and from 2003 to 2005. The temperature was 1-3 degrees C higher than the mean summer value (24 degrees C) and remained high over a long period. During these summers, mass-mortality events, affecting several sessile benthic species, were reported. In the present study, we tested the long-term (3-7 weeks) effect of different temperatures (20 degrees C measured in spring and autumn, 24 degrees C observed in summer, and 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C abnormal summer values) on two Mediterranean corals, Cladocora caespitosa and Oculina patagonica. Growth rate, photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), relative electron transport rate (ETR), zooxanthellae and chlorophyll (chl) contents were measured during 48 days incubation. At 20 degrees C, all parameters remained constant during the whole experiment for both species. At higher temperatures, most physiological parameters were affected by only 2-5 weeks at 24 degrees C, and were severely depressed at higher temperatures. Small replicate samples (nubbins) of O. patagonica significantly decreased their zooxanthellae and chl concentrations at all temperatures, after 2 weeks of incubation. Their Fv/Fm values, as well as their growth rates, were also gradually reduced during the incubation at all temperatures. However, only a few nubbins maintained at 28 degrees C showed signs of tissue necrosis after 34 days, and these gradually recovered tissue when temperature was returned to normal. In nubbins of C. caespitosa, chl and zooxanthellae concentrations decreased only after 34 days of incubation at 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C. At the same time, tissue necrosis was observed, explaining the loss of the symbionts. Fv/Fm was reduced only after 34 days of incubation at the different temperatures, and growth rate was first enhanced, before collapsing by 30% at 24 degrees C and by 90-100% at 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C. All samples maintained at 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C had died, due to tissue necrosis, by the end of the experiment. Results obtained suggest that O. patagonica is more able than C. caespitosa to resist high temperature conditions because of its rapid bleaching capacity. In contrast, it seems that C. caespitosa is living close to its thermal limit during the summer period; therefore, a long-term increase at 24 degrees C or above could be lethal for this coral, just as was observed in situ during the recent warm summers.},

Ninety-eight percent of the zooxanthellae are expelled within four days. Low temperature incubation had no detectable effect on host animal survival or behavior, but the effect on zooxanthellae was profound. Low temperature reduced the rate of photosynthesis, increased the rate of release of fixed carbon, reduced the number of viable cells and decreased the rate of cell division. Electron micrographs revealed that low temperature elicited the appearance of a thickened cell envelope and novel electron-dense inclusions, tentatively identified as crystallized lipoprotein. Immediately after low temperature incubation zooxanthellae move towards the apex of the host cells and are released to the coelenteron by exocytosis. The mechanisms by which low temperature may evoke exocytosis of zooxanthellae (e.g., disassembly of host cell microtubules; increased concentration of cytosolic calcium ions) are discussed.},

abstract = {In addition to the established role of the mitochondria in energy 1 metabolism, regulation of cell death has emerged as a second major function of these organelles. This seems to be intimately linked to their generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been implicated in mtDNA mutations, aging, and cell death. Mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis occurs by mechanisms, which have been conserved through evolution. Thus, many lethal agents target the mitochondria and cause release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c release is initiated by the dissociation of the hemoprotein from its binding to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Oxidation of cardiolipin reduces cytochrome c binding and increases the level of soluble cytochrome c in the intermembrane space. Subsequent release of the hemoprotein occurs by pore formation mediated by pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, or by Ca2+ and ROS-triggered mitochondrial permeability transition, although the latter pathway might be more closely associated with necrosis. Taken together, these findings have placed the mitochondria in the focus of current cell death research.},

abstract = {Coral dinoflagellate symbionts (zooxanthellae) are known to produce the multifaceted sulfur compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) but its role in coral symbioses remains obscure. As methods for quantifying DMSP from isolated symbionts or intact symbioses are not standardized, the aim of this study was to improve DMSP measurements in these fields. We focused on issues pertaining to the separation of host and symbiont, multiple DMSP extraction techniques and several normalization indices in four reef building coral species. Measurements of total DMSP (coral and zooxanthellae; DMSPt) and particulate DMSP (zooxanthellae; DMSPp) levels were made in Montastraea cavernosa, Madracis mirabilis, Montastraea franksi and Porites asteroides together with common DMSP indices including, chlorophyll-a, zooxanthellae number/size, total protein, coral surface area and polyp number. Several potential preparation methods for quantifying DMSPt and/or DMSPp were investigated; coral fragments placed directly in MeOH and airbrushed coral homogenates placed in either methanol (MeOH) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH). DMSP values varied among the corals and according to the type of normalization indice used, which was limited by the chosen preparation method. DMSPt was most efficiently recovered from coral homogenates extracted in MeOH. Additionally, for two of the four coral species, DMSPp was highest in homogenates extracted in MeOH. All corals had higher DMSPt than DMSPp concentrations (typically 2-3x) when analyzed using the same preparation method, suggesting that DMSP may be translocated from symbiont to host thus highlighting the need for both DMSPp and DMSPt measures to fully understand the physiological significance of this DMSP partitioning in corals. These results suggest that DMSPt and DMSPp in previously frozen, field-collected corals is best quantified by placing the airbrushed coral tissue homogenate in MeOH and subsequently measuring DMS via headspace analysis after the addition of strong base and sufficient equilibration time.

abstract = {Insight into the response of reef corals and other major marine calcifiers to ocean acidification is limited by a lack of knowledge about how seawater pH and carbonate chemistry impact the physiological processes that drive biomineralization. Ocean acidification is proposed to reduce calcification rates in corals by causing declines in internal pH at the calcifying tissue-skeleton interface where biomineralization takes place. Here, we performed an in vivo study on how partial-pressure CO(2)-driven seawater acidification impacts intracellular pH in coral calcifying cells and extracellular pH in the fluid at the tissue-skeleton interface [subcalicoblastic medium (SCM)] in the coral Stylophora pistillata. We also measured calcification in corals grown under the same conditions of seawater acidification by measuring lateral growth of colonies and growth of aragonite crystals under the calcifying tissue. Our findings confirm that seawater acidification decreases pH of the SCM, but this decrease is gradual relative to the surrounding seawater, leading to an increasing pH gradient between the SCM and seawater. Reductions in calcification rate, both at the level of crystals and whole colonies, were only observed in our lowest pH treatment when pH was significantly depressed in the calcifying cells in addition to the SCM. Overall, our findings suggest that reef corals may mitigate the effects of seawater acidification by regulating pH in the SCM, but they also highlight the role of calcifying cell pH homeostasis in determining the response of reef corals to changes in external seawater pH and carbonate chemistry.},

abstract = {We report that associations between mutualistic fungi and their economically and ecologically important woodwasp hosts are not always specific as was previously assumed. Woodwasps in the genus Sirex engage in obligate nutritional ectosymbioses with two species of Amylostereum, a homobasid\iomycete genus of white rot fungi. In the present study, the Amylostereum species and genotypes associated with three species of Sirex native to eastern North America and one relatively recent invasive Sirex from Europe were investigated by comparing intergenic spacer regions (IGS). Sirex spp. were sampled over 6 years from 23 sites in six US states, ranging from Maine in the northeast to Louisiana in the southeast, to obtain samples of Amylostereum from mycangia of adult females. Two of the native Sirex species (Sirex nigricornis and Sirex nitidus) were associated with either Amylostereum chailletii or Amylostereum areolatum, refuting the hypothesis of strict species-specific relationships. However, the invasive Sirex noctilio and the native Sirex cyaneus were each collected with only A. areolatum or A. chailletii, respectively, although S. noctilio was associated with two different IGS genotypes of A. areolatum and S. cyaneus occurs sympatrically with the other native Sirex. In Pinus, the preferred host tree of S. nigricornis and S. noctilio, these species co-occurred in 25.9~% of trees sampled, and horizontal transmission of fungal strains from S. noctilio to S. nigricornis was documented, although only in one tree. The extent that further spread and establishment of S. noctilio will alter the composition of symbionts carried by native Sirex is unknown but will depend in part on the degree of flexibility in these host-symbiont associations.},

abstract = {This study investigated the photo-acclimation capacity of the coral Stylophora pistillata (Esper). Outer branches of coral colonies, taken from 2 m, were subjected to 90, 20, or 3% of incident surface photosynthetic active radiation (PAR(0)), or kept in total darkness. The corals were maintained either in filtered seawater (i.e., under starvation), or in seawater that had daily additions of zooplankton (rotifers). The experiments were maintained for 31 days. Zooxanthellae population densities and chlorophyll concentrations increased in S. pistaillata fragments subjected to 20 and 3% PAR(0). The zooxanthellae densities decreased after 6 days in corals kept in total darkness, although chlorophyll concentrations remained higher. Corals that were fed and subjected to 90% PAR(0) showed lower degrading zooxanthellae frequencies, higher photosynthetic and respiration rates, and higher chlorophyll concentrations than corals in the same light regime under starvation. Complete acclimation to dim (20% PAR(0)) and low (3% PAR(0)) light was only apparent for corals fed with zooplankton. Changes in zooxanthellae population densities occurred through differential rates of zooxanthellae division and degradation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The primary productivity of four species of crustose coralline algae was measured as a function of depth (0-18 m) and irradiance on samples collected from and growing upon the windward coral reef at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Significantly higher productivities were measured in the field than in the laboratory. Maximum gross oxygen production in situ varied from 12.8 to 22.8 mmol m(-2) h(-1); dark respiration consumed between 2.7 and 4.5 mmol O-2 m(-2) h(-1). Integration of photosynthesis-irradiance models with half sine curve approximations of whole-day iffadiance yielded estimated in situ net productivities of 15-132 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1). When multiplied by previously determined photosynthetic quotients, in situ net carbon fixation was estimated to vary from 0.2 to 1.3 g m(-2) d(-1). Multiplying these rates by measured surface relief factors of 3.1 for the reef crest and 5.0 for the windward slope yielded estimated contributions to reef organic production of 0.9-5 g C (net) planar m(-2) d(-1) over the depth interval 0-18 m, given 100% cover. These data suggest that crustose coralline algae make a larger contribution to organic production on coral reefs than has been thought to this time. A curvilinear model is presented that enables their primary productivity to be estimated from measurements of in situ irradiance at the solar zenith.},

abstract = {The effects of ocean acidification and elevated seawater temperature on coral calcification and photosynthesis have been extensively investigated over the last two decades, whereas they are still unknown on nutrient uptake, despite their importance for coral energetics. We therefore studied the separate and combined impacts of increases in temperature and p CO 2 on phosphate, ammonium, and nitrate uptake rates by the scleractinian coral S. pistillata . Three experiments were performed, during 10 days i) at three pH T conditions (8.1, 7.8, and 7.5) and normal temperature (26{\textdegree}C), ii) at three temperature conditions (26{\textdegree}, 29{\textdegree}C, and 33{\textdegree}C) and normal pH T (8.1), and iii) at three pH T conditions (8.1, 7.8, and 7.5) and elevated temperature (33{\textdegree}C). After 10 days of incubation, corals had not bleached, as protein, chlorophyll, and zooxanthellae contents were the same in all treatments. However, photosynthetic rates significantly decreased at 33{\textdegree}C, and were further reduced for the pH T 7.5. The photosynthetic efficiency of PSII was only decreased by elevated temperature. Nutrient uptake rates were not affected by a change in pH alone. Conversely, elevated temperature (33{\textdegree}C) alone induced an increase in phosphate uptake but a severe decrease in nitrate and ammonium uptake rates, even leading to a release of nitrogen into seawater. Combination of high temperature (33{\textdegree}C) and low pH T (7.5) resulted in a significant decrease in phosphate and nitrate uptake rates compared to control corals (26{\textdegree}C, pH T  = 8.1). These results indicate that both inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism may be negatively affected by the cumulative effects of ocean warming and acidification.},

Plants were grown in a greenhouse in pot cultures using a soil low in plant-available P under three P regimes: no additional P, P added as KH(2)PO(4), or P uptake enhanced by colonization of the host plant with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxt. sensu Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe. Development of the VAM fungal endophyte and of plants under all three P regimes was depressed by limiting light. However, the growth response of VAM plants to increasing light relative to non-VAM plants in the absence of additional P increased while the response relative to non-VAM plants with additional P decreased slightly. The highly significant interaction between the factors (P < 0.001) of the experiment was due to differences in the magnitude and direction of simple effects of the factors. The implications of these differences in terms of source-sink relationships of the symbionts and the value of different non-VAM controls in interpreting VAM effects are discussed.},

abstract = {Sensitive molecular analyses show that most corals host a complement of Symbiodinium genotypes that includes thermo-tolerant types in low abundance. While tolerant symbiont types are hypothesized to facilitate tolerance to temperature and recovery from bleaching, empirical data on their distribution and relative abundance in corals under ambient and stress conditions are still rare. We quantified visual bleaching and mortality of coral hosts, along with relative abundance of C- and D-type Symbiodinium cells in 82 Acropora millepora colonies from three locations on the Great Barrier Reef transplanted to a central inshore site over a 13 month period. Our analyses reveal dynamic change in symbiont associations within colonies and among populations over time. Coral bleaching and declines in C- but not D-type symbionts were observed in transplanted corals. Survival and recovery of 25% of corals from one population was associated with either initial D-dominance or an increase in D-type symbionts that could be predicted by a minimum pre-stress D : C ratio of 0.003. One-third of corals from this population became D dominated at the bleached stage despite no initial detection of this symbiont type, but failed to recover and died in mid to late summer. These results provide a predictive threshold minimum density of background D-type symbionts in A. millepora, above which survival following extreme thermal stress is increased.},

To make an explicit link between theory on the causes and consequences of biodiversity, we define in a precise way two kinds of differences among species: niche differences, which promote coexistence, and relative fitness differences, which promote competitive exclusion. In a classic model of exploitative competition, promoting coexistence by increasing niche differences typically, although not universally, increases the {\textquotedblleft}relative yield total,{\textquotedblright} a measure of diversity's effect on the biomass of competitors. In addition, however, we show that promoting coexistence by decreasing relative fitness differences also increases the relative yield total. Thus, two fundamentally different mechanisms of species coexistence both strengthen the ...},

abstract = {Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a perspective on population ecology whose starting point is energy utilization by, and homeostasis within, individual organisms. It is natural to ask what it adds to the existing large body of individual-based ecological theory. We approach this question pragmatically--through detailed study of the individual physiology and population dynamics of the zooplankter Daphnia and its algal food. Standard DEB theory uses several state variables to characterize the state of an individual organism, thereby making the transition to population dynamics technically challenging, while ecologists demand maximally simple models that can be used in multi-scale modelling. We demonstrate that simpler representations of individual bioenergetics with a single state variable (size), and two life stages (juveniles and adults), contain sufficient detail on mass and energy budgets to yield good fits to data on growth, maturation and reproduction of individual Daphnia in response to food availability. The same simple representations of bioenergetics describe some features of Daphnia mortality, including enhanced mortality at low food that is not explicitly incorporated in the standard DEB model. Size-structured, population models incorporating this additional mortality component resolve some long-standing questions on stability and population cycles in Daphnia. We conclude that a bioenergetic model serving solely as a 'regression' connecting organismal performance to the history of its environment can rest on simpler representations than those of standard DEB. But there are associated costs with such pragmatism, notably loss of connection to theory describing interspecific variation in physiological rates. The latter is an important issue, as the type of detailed study reported here can only be performed for a handful of species.},

abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},

In April 1998, during a period of high sea surface temperatures, tissue samples were taken from bleached and unbleached colonies representative of 17 soft coral genera. The genetic identities of intracellular dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) in these samples were analyzed using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting analysis of the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2. Alcyonaceans from the GBR exhibited a high level of symbiont specificity for Symbiodinium types mostly in clade C. A rare clade D type (D3) was associated only with Clavularia koellikeri, while Nephthea sp. hosted symbionts in clade B (B1n and B36). Homogenous Symbiodinium clade populations were detected in all but one colony. Colonies that appeared bleached possessed symbiont types that were genetically indistinguishable from those in nonbleached conspecifics. These data suggest that parameters other than the resident endosymbionts such as host identity and colony acclimatization are important in determining bleaching susceptibility among soft corals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:the analysis of microbial communities through dna sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data.

RESULTS:Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research.

CONCLUSIONS:The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

abstract = {Corals acquire nutrients via the transfer of photosynthates by their endosymbionts (autotrophy), or via zooplankton predation by the animal (heterotrophy). During stress events, corals lose their endosymbionts, and undergo starvation, unless they increase their heterotrophic capacities. Molecular mechanisms by which heterotrophy sustains metabolism in stressed corals remain elusive. Here for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we identified specific genes expressed in heterotrophically fed and unfed colonies of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata, maintained under normal and light-stress conditions. Physiological parameters and gene expression profiling demonstrated that fed corals better resisted stress than unfed ones by exhibiting less oxidative damage and protein degradation. Processes affected in light-stressed unfed corals (HLU), were related to energy and metabolite supply, carbohydrate biosynthesis, ion and nutrient transport, oxidative stress, Ca(2+) homeostasis, metabolism and calcification (carbonic anhydrases, calcium-transporting ATPase, bone morphogenetic proteins). Two genes (cp2u1 and cp1a2), which belong to the cytochrome P450 superfamily, were also upregulated 249 and 10 times, respectively, in HLU corals. In contrast, few of these processes were affected in light-stressed fed corals (HLF) because feeding supplied antioxidants and energetic molecules, which help repair oxidative damage. Altogether, these results show that heterotrophy helps prevent the cascade of metabolic problems downstream of oxidative stress.},

abstract = {During the austral summer of 2001/2002, a coral epizootic occurred almost simultaneously with a bleaching event on the fringing reefs of Magnetic Island (Great Barrier Reef region), Australia. This resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in the mean percentage of partial mortality rate in a population of the hard coral Montipora aequituberculata. The putative disease state, 'atramentous necrosis', was observed on both bleached and normally-pigmented M. aequituberculata, and presented blackened lesions that spread within days across the colony surface and throughout the population. Diseased portions of the corals were only visible for 3 to 4 wk, with diseased tissues becoming covered in sediment and algae, which rapidly obscured evidence of the outbreak. Diseased colonies were again observed in the summer of 2002/2003 after being absent over the 2002 winter. Analysis of when diseased and bleached corals were first observed, and when and where the mortality occurred on individual colonies, indicated virtually all the mortality over the summer could be attributed to the disease and not to the bleaching. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) techniques and cloning, and analysis of the 16S rRNA genes from diseased coral tissue, identified a mixed microbial assemblage in the diseased tissues particularly within the Alphaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. While it is not possible in this study to distinguish between a disease-causing microbial community versus secondary invaders, the bacterial 16S rDNA sequences identified within the blackened lesions demonstrated high similarity to sequences from black band disease and white plague infected corals, suggesting either common aetiological agents or development of a bacterial community that is specific to degrading coral tissues. Temperature-induced coral disease outbreaks, with the potential for elevated levels of mortality, may represent an added problem for corals during the warmer summer months and an added dimension to predicted increases in water temperature from climate change.},

abstract = {Coral mortality due to climate-associated stress is likely to increase as the oceans get warmer and more acidic. Coral bleaching and an increase in infectious disease are linked to above average sea surface temperatures. Despite the uncertain future for corals, recent studies have revealed physiological mechanisms that improve coral resilience to the effects of climate change. Some taxa of bleached corals can increase heterotrophic food intake and exchange symbionts for more thermally tolerant clades; this plasticity can increase the probability of surviving lethal thermal stress. Corals can fight invading pathogens with a suite of innate immune responses that slow and even arrest pathogen growth and reduce further tissue damage. Several of these responses, such as the melanin cascade, circulating amoebocytes and antioxidants, are induced in coral hosts during pathogen invasion or disease. Some components of immunity show thermal resilience and are enhanced during temperature stress and even in bleached corals. These examples suggest some plasticity and resilience to cope with environmental change and even the potential for evolution of resistance to disease. However, there is huge variability in responses among coral species, and the rate of climate change is projected to be so rapid that only extremely hardy taxa are likely to survive the projected changes in climate stressors.},

abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

abstract = {The importance of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 290 to 400 nm), and UVB (290 to 320 nm) in particular, as an environmental factor affecting the biology and ecology of coral reefs has taken on renewed interest since the demonstration of global stratospheric ozone loss through human activities. The hermatypic coral Montastraea faveolata occurs over a wide bathymetric range in the Florida Keys reef tract. The bathymetric range of M, faveolata and its role in reef community structure make it an important species for which to assess the effects of present day UVR irradiances. Both UVR irradiances and UVR-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) decreased significantly with increasing depth in M, faveolata. WE irradiances were measured to a depth of 30 m during this study and maximum rates of productivity in M, faveolata were significantly affected by the presence of UVR. Action spectra (= biological weighting function) for the photoinhibition of photosynthesis by WR were measured for samples of M, faveolata at 3, 10, 18, 23, and 30 m. Using these action spectra, radiation amplification factors (RAFs) were calculated for corals at the same depths. RAFs for M, faveolata suggest that corals at depths greater than 3 m will be more sensitive to increases in WE irradiance, such as might be caused by ozone depletion, than their shallow-water counterparts. Despite this increase in sensitivity to UVB, calculations incorporating continued ozone depletion suggest that at the present rate of stratospheric ozone depletion corals deeper than 5 m in the Florida Keys will be affected very little, if at all, by increases in UVR. These results, however, do not incorporate the interacting and synergistic effects of UVR with other physical parameters (e.g. temperature) that will be essential to understanding and predicting the fate of coral reefs under conditions of global change.},

abstract = {Despite the enormous ecological and economic importance of coral reefs, the keystone organisms in their establishment, the scleractinian corals, increasingly face a range of anthropogenic challenges including ocean acidification and seawater temperature rise. To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying coral biology, here we decoded the approximately 420-megabase genome of Acropora digitifera using next-generation sequencing technology. This genome contains approximately 23,700 gene models. Molecular phylogenetics indicate that the coral and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis diverged approximately 500 million years ago, considerably earlier than the time over which modern corals are represented in the fossil record (∼240 million years ago). Despite the long evolutionary history of the endosymbiosis, no evidence was found for horizontal transfer of genes from symbiont to host. However, unlike several other corals, Acropora seems to lack an enzyme essential for cysteine biosynthesis, implying dependency of this coral on its symbionts for this amino acid. Corals inhabit environments where they are frequently exposed to high levels of solar radiation, and analysis of the Acropora genome data indicates that the coral host can independently carry out de novo synthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, which are potent ultraviolet-protective compounds. In addition, the coral innate immunity repertoire is notably more complex than that of the sea anemone, indicating that some of these genes may have roles in symbiosis or coloniality. A number of genes with putative roles in calcification were identified, and several of these are restricted to corals. The coral genome provides a platform for understanding the molecular basis of symbiosis and responses to environmental changes.},

Nor has the potential impact of this triazine upon photosynthesis of endosymbiotic microalgae (zooxanthellae) in corals been assessed. In this study Irgarol 1051 was detected in marinas, harbours and coastal waters of the Florida Keys, Bermuda and St. Croix, with concentrations ranging between 3 and 294 ng l(-1). C-14 incubation experiments with isolated zooxanthellae from the common inshore coral Madracis mirabilis showed no incorporation of (HCO(3) over bar)-C-14 from the sea water medium after 4-8 h exposure to Irgarol 1051 concentrations as low as 63 ng l(-1). Reduction in net photosynthesis of intact corals was found at concentrations of 100 ng l(-1) with little or no photosynthesis at concentrations exceeding 1000 ng l(-1) after 2-8 h exposure at all irradiances. The data suggest Irgarol 1051 to be both prevalent in tropical marine ecosystems and a potent inhibitor of coral photosynthesis at environmentally relevant concentrations, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

That adapter must be found and removed error-tolerantly from each read before read mapping. Previous solutions are either hard to use or do not offer required features, in particular support for color space data. As an easy to use alternative, we developed the command-line tool cutadapt, which supports 454, Illumina and SOLiD (color space) data, offers two adapter trimming algorithms, and has other useful features.

Excreted photosynthate was mostly glycerol after short term incubations, and sometimes but only after longer incubations, there was a majority of glycolic acid. there was {\&}lt;10% glucose in excretion. Intracellular products were mostly glucose.

Zoox. washed free of host homogenate excreted very little photosynthate, although they fixed significant amts. carbon.

abstract = {Ecologists often contrast diversity (species richness and abundances) using tests for comparing means or indices. However, many popular software applications do not support performing standard inferential statistics for estimates of species richness and/or density. In this study we simulated the behavior of asymmetric log-normal confidence intervals and determined an interval level that mimics statistical tests with P($\alpha$) = 0.05 when confidence intervals from two distributions do not overlap. Our results show that 84% confidence intervals robustly mimic 0.05 statistical tests for asymmetric confidence intervals, as has been demonstrated for symmetric ones in the past. Finally, we provide detailed user-guides for calculating 84% confidence intervals in two of the most robust and highly-used freeware related to diversity measurements for wildlife (i.e., EstimateS , Distance ).},

However, diel cycles in naturally occurring heterotrophic bacteria and archaea have rarely been observed. Here, we report time-resolved whole-genome transcriptome profiles of multiple, naturally occurring oceanic bacterial populations sampled in situ over 3 days. As anticipated, the cyanobacterial transcriptome exhibited pronounced diel periodicity. Unexpectedly, several different heterotrophic bacterioplankton groups also displayed diel cycling in many of their gene transcripts. Furthermore, diel oscillations in different heterotrophic bacterial groups suggested population-specific timing of peak transcript expression in a variety of metabolic gene suites. These staggered multispecies waves of diel gene transcription may influence both the tempo and the mode of matter and energy transformation in the sea.},

A comparison of subsurface water temperatures between 1993 and 1992 (when bleaching did not occurred) revealed that the mean annual water temperature was higher in 1993, but the number of hours when the temperature exceeded 29.1 degrees C was less. To determine the rate and extent of recovery of bleached Montastraea, colonies on Saba Island off St. Thomas, USVI, were tagged and photographed at regular intervals. Recovery of pigmentation had commenced by December 1993, two months after bleaching was first observed. Partial mortality of some colonies was first visible at the next sampling period two months later. Six months after bleaching commenced only 50% of colonies had fully recovered and 11 months after the bleaching event all colonies had normal pigmentation and no entire colonies had died. This study suggests that long term, in situ, high resolution seawater temperature data sets are important in assessing environmental changes that may alter coral reef communities.},

abstract = {Early marker-based metagenomic studies were performed without properly accounting for the effects of noise (sequencing errors, PCR single-base errors, and PCR chimeras). Denoising algorithms have been developed, but they were validated using data derived from mock communities, in which the true sequences were known. Since the algorithms were designed to be used in real community studies, it is important to evaluate the results in such cases. With this goal in mind, we processed a real 16S rRNA metagenomic dataset through five denoising pipelines. By reconstituting the sequence reads at each stage of the pipelines, we determined how the reads were being altered. In one denoising pipeline, AmpliconNoise, we found that the algorithm that was designed to remove pyrosequencing errors changed the reads in a manner inconsistent with the known spectrum of these errors, until one of the parameters was increased substantially from its default value. Additionally, because the longest read was picked as the representative for each cluster, sequences were added to the 3' ends of shorter reads that were often dissimilar from what had been removed by the truncations of the previous filtering step. In QIIME, the denoising algorithm caused a much larger number of changes to the reads unless the parameters were changed from their defaults. The denoising pipeline in mothur avoided some of these negative side-effects because of its strict default filtering criteria, but these criteria also greatly limited the sequence information produced at the end of the pipeline. We recommend that those using these denoising pipelines be cognizant of these issues and examine how their reads are being transformed by the denoising process as a component of their analysis.},

Mature spermatocytes and oocytes were found in both species and were usually present in the same polyp in nearly equal ratios. Numerous zooxanthellae were observed in mature, unfertilized oocytes. Although spawning in field populations was not observed, it is likely that both pocilloporids are simultaneous hermaphroditic spawners, as evidenced by the disappearance of mature gametes after full moon. This is in contrast with most known pocilloporid corals that brood and release planula larvae. Corals were reproductively most active in the thermally stable environments of Costa Rica and the Gulf of Chiriqui (Panama) where 32 to 90% of all colonies contained gametes. In the moderately varying thermal conditions in the Galapagos Islands, 16 to 40% of colonies contained gametes, and in the pronounced seasonal upwelling environment of the Pearl Islands (Panama) only 6 to 18% of colonies contained gametes. Year-round reproduction occurred in Costa Rica and the Gulf of Chiriqui, whereas reproduction was confined to warm periods in the seasonally varying environments of the Galapagos Islands and the Gulf of Panama. Pocilloporid corals in Costa Rica and the Gulf of Chiriqui demonstrated lunar spawning activity, with mature gametes present a few days before and after full moon. Some limited spawning may have occurred also at new moon. While frequent gamete maturation has been demonstrated in this study, the relatively low rates of larval recruitment occurring on eastern Pacific coral reefs disturbed by the 1982-83 El Nino suggest that the recovery of important frame-building corals could be greatly prolonged.},

abstract = {Climate change scenarios suggest an increase in tropical ocean temperature by 1-3{\textdegree}C by 2099, potentially killing many coral reefs. But Arabian/Persian Gulf corals already exist in this future thermal environment predicted for most tropical reefs and survived severe bleaching in 2010, one of the hottest years on record. Exposure to 33-35{\textdegree}C was on average twice as long as in non-bleaching years. Gulf corals bleached after exposure to temperatures above 34{\textdegree}C for a total of 8 weeks of which 3 weeks were above 35{\textdegree}C. This is more heat than any other corals can survive, providing an insight into the present limits of holobiont adaptation. We show that average temperatures as well as heat-waves in the Gulf have been increasing, that coral population levels will fluctuate strongly, and reef-building capability will be compromised. This, in combination with ocean acidification and significant local threats posed by rampant coastal development puts even these most heat-adapted corals at risk. WWF considers the Gulf ecoregion as "critically endangered". We argue here that Gulf corals should be considered for assisted migration to the tropical Indo-Pacific. This would have the double benefit of avoiding local extinction of the world's most heat-adapted holobionts while at the same time introducing their genetic information to populations na{\"\i}ve to such extremes, potentially assisting their survival. Thus, the heat-adaptation acquired by Gulf corals over 6 k, could benefit tropical Indo-Pacific corals who have <100 y until they will experience a similarly harsh climate. Population models suggest that the heat-adapted corals could become dominant on tropical reefs within ∼20 years.},

They enable identification and relative quantification of community members and offer new insights into fungal community ecology. These methods are currently taking over as the primary tool to assess fungal communities of plant-associated endophytes, pathogens, and mycorrhizal symbionts, as well as free-living saprotrophs. Taking advantage of the collective experience of six research groups, we here review the different stages involved in fungal community analysis, from field sampling via laboratory procedures to bioinformatics and data interpretation. We discuss potential pitfalls, alternatives, and solutions. Highlighted topics are challenges involved in: obtaining representative DNA/RNA samples and replicates that encompass the targeted variation in community composition, selection of marker regions and primers, options for amplification and multiplexing, handling of sequencing errors, and taxonomic identification. Without awareness of methodological biases, limitations of markers, and bioinformatics challenges, large-scale sequencing projects risk yielding artificial results and misleading conclusions.},

abstract = {The ability of scleractinian corals to survive changes that are predicted in the global environment over the next century will lie in their physiological mechanisms of acclimatization. Corals display rapid modifications in behavior, morphology and physiology enabling them to photoacclimate to changing light conditions, a scenario that demonstrates considerable biological flexibility. Here we argue that the acclimatization mechanisms in corals are fundamentally similar to those exhibited by other invertebrate taxa, We discuss protein metabolism as a mechanism underlying acclimatization responses in reef corals, and explore the relationship between protein turnover, metabolic rate, growth rate, and acclimatization capacity. Our preliminary analyses suggest that corals with low growth rates (mu Ca/mgN/h) and high metabolic rates (mu O-2/cm(2)/hr), such as the massive species, acclimatize more effectively than those with high growth rates and low metabolic rates, a feature that is characteristic of branching species. We conclude that studies of protein turnover, combined with temporally relevant investigations into the dynamic aspects of coral dinoflagellate symbioses will provide considerable insight into why corals exhibit such a high level of variation in response to the same environmental challenge. Furthermore, a more detailed understanding of acclimatization mechanisms is essential if we are to predict how a coral assemblage will respond to present and future environmental challenges.},

The affected intertidal coral had been exposed to unusually cold (minimum = 13.3degreesC; wet bulb temperature = 9degreesC) and dry winds (44% relative humidity) for 2 d during predawn low tides. Coral bleached in the upper 10 cm of their branches and had less than 0.2 x 10(6) cell cm(-2) as compared with over 2.5 x 10(6), Cell cm(-2) in nonbleached areas. Dark-adapted quantum yields did not differ between symbionts in bleached and nonbleached areas. Exposing symbionts to light, however, led to greater quenching of Photosystem 11 in symbionts in the bleached coral. Bleached areas of the affected colonies had died by September 2003, with areas that were essentially covered by more than 80% living coral decreasing to less than 10% visible living coral cover. By January 2004, coral began to recover, principally from areas of colonies that were not exposed during low tide (i.e., from below dead, upper regions). These data highlight the importance of understanding local weather patterns as well as the effects of longer term trends in global climate.},

abstract = {Caribbean coral reefs are widely thought to exhibit two alternate stable states with one being dominated by coral and the other by macroalgae. However, the observation of linear empirical relationships among grazing, algal cover and coral recruitment has led the existence of alternate stable states to be questioned; are reefs simply exhibiting a continuous phase shift in response to grazing or are the alternate states robust to certain changes in grazing? Here, a model of a Caribbean forereef is used to reconcile the existence of two stable community states with common empirical observations. Coral-depauperate and coral-dominated reef states are predicted to be stable on equilibrial time scales of decades to centuries and their emergence depends on the presence or absence of a bottleneck in coral recruitment, which is determined by threshold levels of grazing intensity and other process variables. Under certain physical and biological conditions, corals can be persistently depleted even while increases in grazing reduce macroalgal cover and enhance coral recruitment; only once levels of recruitment becomes sufficient to overwhelm the population bottleneck will the coral-dominated state begin to emerge. Therefore, modest increases in grazing will not necessarily allow coral populations to recover, whereas large increases, such as those associated with recovery of the urchin Diadema antillarum, are likely to exceed threshold levels of grazing intensity and set a trajectory of coral recovery. The postulated existence of alternate stable states is consistent with field observations of linear relationships between grazing, algal cover and coral recruitment when coral cover is low and algal exclusion when coral cover is high. The term 'macroalgal dominated' is potentially misleading because the coral-depauperate state can be associated with various levels of macroalgal cover. The term 'coral depauperate' is preferable to 'macroalgal dominated' when describing alternate states of Caribbean reefs.},

abstract = {In a recent communication by Stat and Gates (Biol Invasions 10: 579-583, 2008), discovery of a symbiotic combination involving the coral Acropora cytherea and the dinoflagellate endosymbiont, Symbiodinium A1 (Symbiodinium microadriaticum, Freudenthal sensu stricto) in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands was interpreted to be the result of a 'recent' introduction. While introductions of symbiotic dinoflagellates have occurred and are occurring, the authors' conclusion was made without sufficient information about the geographic range and host specificity exhibited by A1. The only direct genetic analysis of symbionts from the putative host vector, a jellyfish in the genus Cassiopeia sp., from Kaneohe Bay on the Island of Oahu, found that it contained a different symbiont species, A3. Furthermore, Stat and Gates (Biol Invasions 10: 579-583, 2008) did not consider the importance of host-symbiont specificity in preventing the establishment of a foreign symbiont species. In comparison to A. cytherea, A. longicyathus on the southern most Great Barrier Reef also hosts Symbiodinium A1 and a closely related endemic, A1a. Instead of assuming that A. cytherea has an unnatural association, a practical explanation is that long-term ecological and evolutionary processes influenced by local environments underlie the unusual, but not unprecedented finding of a Pacific acroporid associating with Clade A Symbiodinium spp.},

abstract = {Physiological plasticity and adaptive evolution may facilitate persistence in a changing environment. As a result, there is an interest in understanding species' capacities for plastic and evolved responses, and the mechanisms by which these responses occur. Transcriptome sequencing has become a powerful tool for addressing these questions, providing insight into otherwise unobserved effects of changing conditions on organismal physiology and variation in these effects among individuals and populations. Here, we review recent studies using comparative transcriptomics to understand plastic and evolutionary responses to changing environments. We focus on 2 areas where transcriptomics has played an important role: first, in understanding the genetic basis for local adaptation to current gradients as a proxy for future adaptation, and second, in understanding organismal responses to multiple stressors. We find most studies examining multiple stressors have tested the effects of each stressor individually; the few studies testing multiple stressors simultaneously have found synergistic effects on gene expression that would not have been predicted from single stressor studies. We discuss the importance of robust experimental design to allow for a more sophisticated characterization of transcriptomic responses and conclude by offering recommendations for future research, including integrating genomics with transcriptomics, testing gene regulatory networks, and comparing the equivalence of transcription to translation and the effects of environmental stress on the proteome.},

abstract = {When exposed to stress such as high seawater temperature, corals and other cnidarians can bleach due to loss of symbiotic algae from the host tissue and/or loss of pigments from the algae. Although the environmental conditions that trigger bleaching are reasonably well known, its cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Previous studies have reported the occurrence of at least four different cellular mechanisms for the loss of symbiotic algae from the host tissue: in situ degradation of algae, exocytic release of algae from the host, detachment of host cells containing algae, and death of host cells containing algae. The relative contributions of these several mechanisms to bleaching remain unclear, and it is also not known whether these relative contributions change in animals subjected to different types and/or durations of stresses. In this study, we used a clonal population of the small sea anemone Aiptasia , exposed individuals to various precisely controlled stress conditions, and quantitatively assessed the several possible bleaching mechanisms in parallel. Under all stress conditions tested, except for acute cold shock at 4{\textdegree}C, expulsion of intact algae from the host cells appeared to be by far the predominant mechanism of bleaching. During acute cold shock, in situ degradation of algae and host-cell detachment also became quantitatively significant, and the algae released under these conditions appeared to be severely damaged.},

We summarize the role of thylakoid lumen pH, xanthophylls, and PS2 proteins in qE mechanism. Further, both the similarity between qE and q(I), and specific features of q(I), are described. The other routes of thermal energy dissipation are also mentioned, that is dissipation within photosystem I and dissipation through the triplet Chl pathway. The significance of the individual deexcitation processes in protection against photo-oxidative damage to the photosynthetic apparatus under excess photon supply is stretched.},

abstract = {Exogenous concentrations of 10 mu M to 1 mM of the nonprotein amino acid taurine stimulated photosynthate release from the dinoflagellate alga Symbiodinium, which had been freshly isolated from the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella. Photosynthate release, as induced by taurine and animal extract, was metabolically equivalent at both concentrations in that they (a) stimulated photosynthate release to the same extent and (b) induced the selective release of photosynthetically derived organic acids. A complex mixture of amino acids at 75 mM also promoted photosynthate release, but the release rate was reduced by 34% after the omission of taurine (3 mM) from the mixture, suggesting that much of the effect of amino acids was largely attributable to taurine. Exogenous C-14-labeled taurine was taken up by the cells, and more than 95% of the internalized C-14 was recovered as taurine, indicating that taurine-induced photosynthate release was not dependent on taurine metabolism. Both taurine uptake and taurine-induced photosynthate release by Symbiodinium exhibited saturation kinetics, but with significantly different K-m values of 68 and 21 mu M, respectively. The difference in K-m values is compatible with the hypothesis that Symbiodinium has a taurine signal transducer that is responsible for photosynthate release and is distinct from the taurine transporter.},

Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean was assessed using both the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) 
region of the nuclear rDNA and chloroplast 23S rDNA. More sequences were recovered from corals 
using the ITS2 primers than with the chloroplast 23S primers, a finding that reflects both the higher 
taxonomic resolution and level of intragenomic variation in ITS2 in eukaryotes as compared to 
chloroplast 23S. Parsimony network analysis, Bray-Curtis coefficient of similarity and 1-way analysis 
of similarity resolved coral species- and/or genus-specific lineages and/or groupings of Symbio- 
diniumthat were generally congruent between the 2 genetic markers. Comparison of coral{\textendash}Symbio- 
diniumassemblages at Johnston Atoll with those in corals sampled on other reefs in the Pacific 
reveals differences that include novel host{\textendash}symbiont unions and a Symbiodiniumlineage previously 
reported to be Caribbean-specific in Acroporafrom Johnston Atoll.},

abstract = {Colonies of Stylophora pistillata maintained for four years in indoor aquaria in the near absence of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) contained only small amounts (<5 nmol mg(-1) protein) of 10 identified mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs, which act as UV sunscreens), the largest number reported in any organism. The concentrations of most MAAs increased linearly or exponentially when colonies were exposed to ultraviolet-A (UVA) and ultraviolet-B (UVB) for 8 h d(-1) in the presence of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Total MAA concentration reached 174 nmol mg(-1) protein after 30 d, with palythine and mycosporine-2 glycine constituting more than half of the final total. WE specifically stimulated MAA accumulation: after 15 d, MAA levels in colonies exposed to PAR alone and to PAR and WA did not differ (7 and 5 nmol MAA mg(-1) protein, respectively), while those in colonies exposed to PAR and UVA + UVB were significantly higher (28 nmol mg(-1) protein). Glyphosate, an inhibitor of the shikimate pathway, eliminated or reduced the UV-induced accumulation of most MAAs during 7 d of exposure, providing the first experimental evidence of their synthesis via this pathway in a coral symbiosis. Densities of zooxanthellae in colonies of S. pistillata, Acropora sp., and Seriatopora hystrix exposed to UVR for 15 d were only one-third of those in control colonies unexposed to UVR. This net decrease in the number of zooxanthellae in the corals (bleaching) occurred despite W-stimulated increases in algal cytokinesis and in the host cell-specific density of zooxanthellae in hospite, increases that apparently destabilized the symbiosis and caused expulsion of the zooxanthellae.},

abstract = {Reef-building corals import inorganic carbon (Ci) to build their calcium carbonate skeletons and to support photosynthesis by the symbiotic algae that reside in their tissue. The internal pathways that deliver Ci for both photosynthesis and calcification are known to involve the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), which interconverts CO2 and HCO3 (-). We have developed a method for absolute quantification of internal CA (iCA) activity in coral tissue based on the rate of (18)O-removal from labeled Ci. The method was applied to three Caribbean corals (Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea radians) and showed that these species have similar iCA activities per unit surface area, but that S. radians had ∼10-fold higher iCA activity per unit tissue volume. A model of coral Ci processing shows that the measured iCA activity is sufficient to support the proposed roles for iCA in Ci transport for photosynthesis and calcification. This is the case even when iCA activity is homogeneously distributed throughout the coral, but the model indicates that it would be advantageous to concentrate iCA in the spaces where calcification (the calcifying fluid) and photosynthesis (the oral endoderm) take place. We argue that because the rates of photosynthesis and calcification per unit surface area are similar among the corals studied here, the areal iCA activity used to deliver Ci for these reactions should also be similar. The elevated iCA activity per unit volume of S. radians compared to the other species is probably due to the thinner effective tissue thickness in this species.},

abstract = {Wine grapes present a unique biogeography model, wherein microbial biodiversity patterns across viticultural zones not only answer questions of dispersal and community maintenance, they are also an inherent component of the quality, consumer acceptance, and economic appreciation of a culturally important food product. On their journey from the vineyard to the wine bottle, grapes are transformed to wine through microbial activity, with indisputable consequences for wine quality parameters. Wine grapes harbor a wide range of microbes originating from the surrounding environment, many of which are recognized for their role in grapevine health and wine quality. However, determinants of regional wine characteristics have not been identified, but are frequently assumed to stem from viticultural or geological factors alone. This study used a high-throughput, short-amplicon sequencing approach to demonstrate that regional, site-specific, and grape-variety factors shape the fungal and bacterial consortia inhabiting wine-grape surfaces. Furthermore, these microbial assemblages are correlated to specific climatic features, suggesting a link between vineyard environmental conditions and microbial inhabitation patterns. Taken together, these factors shape the unique microbial inputs to regional wine fermentations, posing the existence of nonrandom "microbial terroir" as a determining factor in regional variation among wine grapes.},

abstract = {Dispersal influences ecological dynamics, evolution, biogeography, and biodiversity conservation, but models of larval dispersal in marine organisms make simplifying assumptions that are likely to approximate poorly the temporal dynamics of larval survival and capacity for settlement. In particular, larval mortality rates are typically assumed to be constant throughout larval life; and all larvae are frequently assumed to acquire and lose competence at the same time. To improve upon these assumptions, we here develop simple models of dispersal potential that incorporate rates of mortality, and acquisition and loss of settlement competence. We fit these models to empirical competence and survival data for five scleractinian coral species, to test the models' ability to characterize empirical survival and competence patterns, and to estimate the dispersal potential implied by those patterns. The models fit the data well, incorporating qualitative features of competence and survival that traditional approaches to modeling dispersal do not, with important implications for dispersal potential. Most notably, there was high within-cohort variation in the duration of the competent period in all species, and this variation increases both self-recruitment and long-distance dispersal compared with models assuming a fixed competent period. These findings help to explain the seeming paradox of high genetic population structure, coupled with large geographic range size, observed in many coral species. More broadly, our approach offers a way to parsimoniously account for variation in competence dynamics in dispersal models, a phenomenon that our results suggest has important effects on patterns of connectivity in marine metapopulations.},

abstract = {Changes in land use and water management practices in south Florida have altered the quality and quantity of freshwater flowing into Florida Bay. By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean.To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis, respiration, and net P:R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P > 0.01), but short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure, however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface, which predicts P: R ratios as a function of varying salinity and temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However, any environmentally realistic model must include other potential stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental contaminants.},

abstract = {Physiological characteristics of zooxanthellae were examined under nutrient-saturated conditions created by mixing ammonium ((NH4)-N-15) with nitrate ((NO3)-N-15) to give 0.88 mM total nitrogen. Growth rate varied with the form Of nitrogen provided. Ammonium alone resulted in the lowest C:N and C:chl-tr ratios. Although zooxanthellae took up nitrate in the absence of ammonium, ammonium assimilation was 1.3 times higher than nitrate assimilation. Ammonium strongly inhibited nitrate assimilation. While high-ammonium treatments resulted in the highest C-14 incorporation into intermediate compounds, high nitrate levels resulted in the highest C-14 incorporation into protein, suggesting that the intermediate compounds are produced prior to the subsequent production of protein when ammonium is the dominant N source. The enhanced production of intermediate compounds at the expense of carbon directed to protein synthesis in the presence of ammonium might be analogous to the "host factor" observed in zooxanthellae-host symbioses, since growth rate is depressed due to low production of protein.},

abstract = {Many organisms have a complex life-cycle in which dispersal occurs at the propagule stage. For marine environments, there is growing evidence that high levels of recruitment back to the natal population (self-recruitment) are common in many marine organisms. For fish, swimming behavior is frequently invoked as a key mechanism allowing high self-recruitment. For organisms with weak-swimming larvae, such as many marine invertebrates, the mechanisms behind self-recruitment are less clear. Here, we assessed whether the combination of passive retention of larvae due to re-circulation processes near reefs, and the dynamics of settlement competence, can produce the high levels of self-recruitment previously estimated by population genetic studies for reef-building corals. Additionally, we investigated whether time to motility, which is more readily measurable than competence parameters, can explain the between-species variation in self-recruitment. We measured the larval competence dynamics of broadcast-spawning and brooding corals and incorporated these in a model of larval retention around reefs to estimate the potential for self-recruitment and assess its variation among species and reefs. Our results suggest that the larvae of many corals, even those with an obligate planktonic phase, develop with sufficient rapidity to allow high levels of self-recruitment, particularly for reefs with long water retention times. Time to motility explained 77-86% of the between-species variation in potential self-recruitment in scenarios with a realistic range of retention times. Among broadcast spawners, time to motility was strongly and positively correlated with egg size, i.e., broadcast spawner species with small eggs developed more rapidly and exhibited greater potential for self-recruitment. These findings suggest that, along with water retention estimates, easy-to-measure species traits, such as egg size and time to motility, may be good predictors of potential self-recruitment, and therefore may be used to characterize the spectrum of self-recruitment in corals.},

abstract = {The great mass extinctions of the fossil record were a major creative force that provided entirely new kinds of opportunities for the subsequent explosive evolution and diversification of surviving clades. Today, the synergistic effects of human impacts are laying the groundwork for a comparably great Anthropocene mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and evolutionary consequences. Synergistic effects of habitat destruction, overfishing, introduced species, warming, acidification, toxins, and massive runoff of nutrients are transforming once complex ecosystems like coral reefs and kelp forests into monotonous level bottoms, transforming clear and productive coastal seas into anoxic dead zones, and transforming complex food webs topped by big animals into simplified, microbially dominated ecosystems with boom and bust cycles of toxic dinoflagellate blooms, jellyfish, and disease. Rates of change are increasingly fast and nonlinear with sudden phase shifts to novel alternative community states. We can only guess at the kinds of organisms that will benefit from this mayhem that is radically altering the selective seascape far beyond the consequences of fishing or warming alone. The prospects are especially bleak for animals and plants compared with metabolically flexible microbes and algae. Halting and ultimately reversing these trends will require rapid and fundamental changes in fisheries, agricultural practice, and the emissions of greenhouse gases on a global scale.},

abstract = {The migration and dispersal of stress-tolerant symbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) may influence the response of symbiotic reef-building corals to a warming climate. We analyzed the genetic structure of the stress-tolerant endosymbiont, Symbiodinium glynni nomen nudum (ITS2 - D1), obtained from Pocillopora colonies that dominate eastern Pacific coral communities. Eleven microsatellite loci identified genotypically diverse populations with minimal genetic subdivision throughout the Eastern Tropical Pacific, encompassing 1000's of square kilometers from mainland Mexico to the Galapagos Islands. The lack of population differentiation over these distances corresponds with extensive regional host connectivity and indicates that Pocillopora larvae, which maternally inherit their symbionts, aid in the dispersal of this symbiont. In contrast to its host, however, subtropical populations of S. glynni in the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) were strongly differentiated from populations in tropical eastern Pacific. Selection pressures related to large seasonal fluctuations in temperature and irradiance likely explain this abrupt genetic discontinuity. We infer that S. glynni genotypes harbored by host larvae arriving from more southern locations are rapidly replaced by genotypes adapted to more temperate environments. The strong population structure of S. glynni corresponds with fluctuating environmental conditions and suggests that these genetically diverse populations have the potential to evolve rapidly to changing environments and reveals the importance of environmental extremes in driving microbial eukaryote (e.g., plankton) speciation in marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {There is a vivid debate on the relative importance of local and regional factors in shaping microbial communities, and on whether microbial organisms show a biogeographic signature in their distribution. Taking a metacommunity approach, spatial factors can become important either through dispersal limitation (compare large spatial scales) or mass effects (in case of strongly connected systems). We here analyze two datasets on bacterial communities [characterized by community fingerprinting through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] in meso- to eutrophic shallow lakes to investigate the importance of spatial factors at three contrasting scales. Variation partitioning on datasets of both the bacterial communities of 11 shallow lakes that are part of a strongly interconnected and densely packed pond system <1 km apart, three groups of shallow lakes approximately 100 km apart, as well as these three groups of shallow lakes combined that span a large part of a North-South gradient in Europe (>2,500 km) shows a strong impact of local environmental factors on bacterial community composition, with a marginal impact of spatial distance. Our results indicate that dispersal is not strongly limiting even at large spatial scales, and that mass effects do not have a strong impact on bacterial communities even in physically connected systems. We suggest that the fast population growth rates of bacteria facilitate efficient species sorting along environmental gradients in bacterial communities over a very broad range of dispersal rates.},

abstract = {1. Both evolutionary theory and empirical evidence from agricultural research support the view that asexual, vertically transmitted fungal endophytes are typically plant mutualists that develop high infection frequencies within host grass populations. In contrast, endophyte-grass interactions in natural ecosystems are more variable, spanning the range from mutualism to antagonism and comparatively little is known about their range of response to environmental stress.2. We examined patterns in endophyte prevalence and endophyte-grass interactions across nutrient and grazing (from Greylag and Canada geese) gradients in 15 sites with different soil moisture levels in 13 island populations of the widespread grass Festuca rubra in a boreal archipelago in Sweden.3. In the field, endophyte prevalence levels were generally low (range = 10-53%) compared with those reported from agricultural systems. Under mesic-moist conditions endophyte prevalence was constantly low (mean prevalence = 15%) and was not affected by grazing pressure or nutrient availability. In contrast, under conditions of drought, endophyte prevalence increased from 10% to 53% with increasing nutrient availability and increasing grazing pressure.4. In the field, we measured the production of flowering culms, as a proxy for host fitness, to determine how endophyte-infected plants differed from uninfected plants. At dry sites, endophyte infection did not affect flowering culm production. In contrast, at mesic-moist sites production of flowering culms in endophyte-infected plants increased with the covarying effects of increasing nutrient availability and grazing pressure, indicating that the interaction switched from antagonistic to mutualistic.5. A concurrent glasshouse experiment showed that in most situations, the host appears to incur some costs for harbouring endophytes. Uninfected grasses generally outperformed infected grasses (antagonistic interaction), while infected grasses outperformed uninfected grasses (mutualistic interaction) only in dry, nutrient-rich conditions. Nutrient and water addition affected tiller production, leaf number and leaf length differently, suggesting that tillers responded with different strategies. This emphasizes that several response variables are needed to evaluate the interaction.6. Synthesis. This study found complex patterns in endophyte prevalence that were not always correlated with culm production. These contrasting patterns suggest that the direction and strength of selection on infected plants is highly variable and depends upon a suite of interacting environmental variables that may fluctuate in the intensity of their impact, during the course of the host life cycle.},

abstract = {The association between cnidarians and photosynthetic dinoflagellates within the genus Symbiodinium is a prevalent relationship in tropical and subtropical marine environments. Although the diversity of Symbiodinium provides a possible axis for niche diversification, increased functional range and resilience to physical stressors such as elevated temperature, how such diversity relates to the physiological balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy of the host animal remains unknown. Here we experimentally show inter- and intraspecific variability of photosynthetic carbon fixation and subsequent translocation by Symbiodinium to the model cnidarian host Aiptasia pallida. By using a clonal anemone line harboring different species of Symbiodinium, we determined that symbiont identity influences trophic plasticity through its density, capacity to fix carbon, quantity of translocated carbon, and ultimately the host's capacity to ingest and digest prey. Symbiont carbon translocation and host prey ingestion were positively correlated across symbiont combinations that consisted of different isoclonal lines of S. minutum, while a combination with type D4-5 Symbiodinium displayed lower carbon translocation, and prey capture and digestion more similar to Aiptasia lacking symbionts. The absence of a shift toward greater heterotrophy when carbon translocation is low suggests that the metabolic demand of feeding and digestion may overwhelm nutritional stores when photosynthesis is reduced, and amends the possible role of animal feeding in resistance to or recovery from the effects of climate change in more obligate symbioses such as reef building corals.},

abstract = {Relationships among families and suborders of scleractinian corals are poorly understood because of difficulties 1) in making inferences about the evolution of the morphological characters used in coral taxonomy and 2) in interpreting their 240-million-year fossil record. Here we describe patterns of molecular evolution in a segment of the mitochondrial (mt) 16S ribosomal gene from taxa of 14 families of corals and the use of this gene segment in a phylogenetic analysis of relationships within the order. We show that sequences obtained from scleractinians are homologous to other metazoan 16S ribosomal sequences and fall into two distinct clades defined by size of the amplified gene product. Comparisons of sequences from the two clades demonstrate that both sets of sequences are evolving under similar evolutionary constraints: they do not differ in nucleotide composition, numbers of transition and transversion substitutions, spatial patterns of substitutions, or in rates of divergence. The characteristics and patterns observed in these sequences as well as the secondary structures, are similar to those observed in mt 16S ribosomal DNA sequences from other taxa. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences shows that they are useful for evaluating relationships within the order. The hypothesis generated from this analysis differs from traditional hypotheses for evolutionary relationships among the Scleractinia and suggests that a reevaluation of evolutionary affinities in the order is needed.},

abstract = {Tropical scleractinian corals are considered autotrophic as they rely mainly on photosynthesis-derived nutrients transferred from their photosymbionts. Corals are also able to capture and ingest suspended particulate organic matter, so heterotrophy can be an important supplementary trophic pathway to optimize coral fitness. The aim of this in situ study was to elucidate the trophic status of 10 coral species under contrasted environmental conditions in a French Polynesian lagoon. Carbon ($\delta$ 13 C) and nitrogen ($\delta$ 15 N) isotopic compositions of coral host tissues and photosymbionts were determined at 3 different fringing reefs during wet and dry seasons. Our results highlighted spatial variability in stable isotopic compositions of both coral host tissues and photosymbionts. Samples from the site with higher level of suspended particulate matter were 13 C-depleted and 15 N-enriched relative to corals and photosymbionts from less turbid sites. However, differences in both $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 15 N between coral host tissues and their photosymbionts ($\Delta$ host-photosymbionts 13 C and $\Delta$ host-photosymbionts 15 N) were small (0.27 {\textpm} 0.76{\textperthousand} and 1.40 {\textpm} 0.90{\textperthousand}, respectively) and similar at all sites, thus indicating no general increases in the heterotrophic pathway. Depleted $\delta$ 13 C and enriched $\delta$ 15 N values of coral host tissues measured at the most turbid site were explained by changes in isotopic composition of the inorganic nutrients taken up by photosymbionts and also by changes in rate of isotopic fractionation with environmental conditions. Our results also highlighted a lack of significant temporal variations in $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 15 N values of coral host and photosymbiont tissues and in $\Delta$ host-photosymbionts 13 C and $\Delta$ host-photosymbionts 15 N values. This temporal stability indicated that corals remained principally autotrophic even during the wet season when photosymbiont densities were lower and the concentrations of phytoplankton were higher. Increased coral heterotrophy with higher food availability thus appears to be species-specific.},

abstract = {The Human Microbiome Project provided a census of bacterial populations in healthy individuals, but an understanding of the biomedical significance of this census has been hindered by limited taxonomic resolution. A high-resolution method termed oligotyping overcomes this limitation by evaluating individual nucleotide positions using Shannon entropy to identify the most information-rich nucleotide positions, which then define oligotypes. We have applied this method to comprehensively analyze the oral microbiome. Using Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene sequence data for the nine sites in the oral cavity, we identified 493 oligotypes from the V1-V3 data and 360 oligotypes from the V3-V5 data. We associated these oligotypes with species-level taxon names by comparison with the Human Oral Microbiome Database. We discovered closely related oligotypes, differing sometimes by as little as a single nucleotide, that showed dramatically different distributions among oral sites and among individuals. We also detected potentially pathogenic taxa in high abundance in individual samples. Numerous oligotypes were preferentially located in plaque, others in keratinized gingiva or buccal mucosa, and some oligotypes were characteristic of habitat groupings such as throat, tonsils, tongue dorsum, hard palate, and saliva. The differing habitat distributions of closely related oligotypes suggest a level of ecological and functional biodiversity not previously recognized. We conclude that the Shannon entropy approach of oligotyping has the capacity to analyze entire microbiomes, discriminate between closely related but distinct taxa and, in combination with habitat analysis, provide deep insight into the microbial communities in health and disease.},

abstract = {The future impact of ocean acidification (OA) on corals is disputed in part because mathematical models used to predict these impacts do not seem to capture, or offer a framework to adequately explain, the substantial variability in acidification effects observed in empirical studies. The build-up of a diffusive boundary layer (DBL), wherein solute transport is controlled by diffusion, can lead to pronounced differences between the bulk seawater pH, and the actual pH experienced by the organism, a factor rarely considered in mathematical modelling of ocean acidification effects on corals. In the present study, we developed a simple diffusion-reaction-uptake model that was experimentally parameterized based on direct microsensor measurements of coral tissue pH and O2 within the DBL of a branching and a massive coral. The model accurately predicts tissue surface pH for different coral morphologies and under different flow velocities as a function of ambient pH. We show that, for all cases, tissue surface pH is elevated at lower flows, and thus thicker DBLs. The relative effects of OA on coral surface pH was controlled by flow and we show that under low flow velocities tissue surface pH under OA conditions (pHSWS = 7.8) can be equal to the pH under normal conditions (pHSWS = 8.2). We conclude that OA effects on corals in nature will be complex as the degree to which they are controlled by flow appears to be species specific.},

abstract = {The Chagos Archipelago designated as a no-take marine protected area in 2010, lying about 500 km south of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, has a high conservation priority, particularly because of its fast recovery from the ocean-wide massive coral mortality following the 1998 coral bleaching event. The aims of this study were to examine Symbiodinium diversity and distribution associated with scleractinian corals in five atolls of the Chagos Archipelago, spread over 10,000 km(2). Symbiodinium clade diversity in 262 samples of seven common coral species, Acropora muricata, Isopora palifera, Pocillopora damicornis, P. verrucosa, P. eydouxi, Seriatopora hystrix, and Stylophora pistillata were determined using PCR-SSCP of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), PCR-DDGE of ITS2, and phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that Symbiodinium in clade C were the dominant symbiont group in the seven coral species. Our analysis revealed types of Symbiodinium clade C specific to coral species. Types C1 and C3 (with C3z and C3i variants) were dominant in Acroporidae and C1 and C1c were the dominant types in Pocilloporidae. We also found 2 novel ITS2 types in S. hystrix and 1 novel ITS2 type of Symbiodinium in A. muricata. Some colonies of A. muricata and I. palifera were also associated with Symbiodinium A1. These results suggest that corals in the Chagos Archipelago host different assemblages of Symbiodinium types then their conspecifics from other locations in the Indian Ocean; and that future research will show whether these patterns in Symbiodinium genotypes may be due to local adaptation to specific conditions in the Chagos.},

abstract = {The crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci (L.) is well adapted to feed on a wide range of different corals, but often exhibits striking preference for a small suite of available prey species. Numerous theories have been forwarded to explain its feeding preferences, but many of these theories have not been tested. In this study, I test whether coral symbionts significantly affect the feeding preferences of crown-of-thorns starfish by removing symbionts from replicate colonies of 6 different coral species. Crown-of-thorns starfish had a clearly defined hierarchy of preference for the 6 different corals when these contained symbionts (Acropora gemmifera > A. nasuta = A. loirpes > Seriatopora hystrix > Pocillopora damicornis > Stylophora pistillata). However, when coral symbionts were removed, then the starfish readily consumed all 6 corals and did not exhibit any significant selectivity. Further manipulation of symbiont assemblages showed that the trapeziid crabs (Tetralia and Trapezia species) were the most effective of the various coral symbionts in deterring starfish from feeding on their host colony. Moreover, those corals that were least preferred by crown-of-thorns starfish contained the largest and most powerful species of Trapezia (T. cymodoce), whereas the most preferred corals contained only very small Tetralia spp. crabs. Further experimentation is required to assess the generality of these results, but for the 6 coral species tested, it is clear that coral symbionts land particularly trapeziid crabs) do have a marked influence on the feeding preferences of the crown-of-thorns starfish.},

abstract = {Most of the studies in Ecology have been devoted to analyzing the effects the environment has on individuals, populations, and communities, thus neglecting the effects of biotic interactions on the system dynamics. In the present work we study the structure of bacterial communities in the oligotrophic shallow water system of Churince, Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico. Since the physicochemical conditions of this water system are homogeneous and quite stable in time, it is an excellent candidate to study how biotic factors influence the structure of bacterial communities. In a previous study, the binary antagonistic interactions of 78 bacterial strains, isolated from Churince, were experimentally determined. We employ these data to develop a computer algorithm to simulate growth experiments in a cellular grid representing the pond. Remarkably, in our model, the dynamics of all the simulated bacterial populations is determined solely by antagonistic interactions. Our results indicate that all bacterial strains (even those that are antagonized by many other bacteria) survive in the long term, and that the underlying mechanism is the formation of bacterial community patches. Patches corresponding to less antagonistic and highly susceptible strains are consistently isolated from the highly-antagonistic bacterial colonies by patches of neutral strains. These results concur with the observed features of the bacterial community structure previously reported. Finally, we study how our findings depend on factors like initial population size, differential population growth rates, homogeneous population death rates, and enhanced bacterial diffusion.},

abstract = {The advent of next generation sequencing has coincided with a growth in interest in using these approaches to better understand the role of the structure and function of the microbial communities in human, animal, and environmental health. Yet, use of next generation sequencing to perform 16S rRNA gene sequence surveys has resulted in considerable controversy surrounding the effects of sequencing errors on downstream analyses. We analyzed 2.7{\texttimes}10(6) reads distributed among 90 identical mock community samples, which were collections of genomic DNA from 21 different species with known 16S rRNA gene sequences; we observed an average error rate of 0.0060. To improve this error rate, we evaluated numerous methods of identifying bad sequence reads, identifying regions within reads of poor quality, and correcting base calls and were able to reduce the overall error rate to 0.0002. Implementation of the PyroNoise algorithm provided the best combination of error rate, sequence length, and number of sequences. Perhaps more problematic than sequencing errors was the presence of chimeras generated during PCR. Because we knew the true sequences within the mock community and the chimeras they could form, we identified 8% of the raw sequence reads as chimeric. After quality filtering the raw sequences and using the Uchime chimera detection program, the overall chimera rate decreased to 1%. The chimeras that could not be detected were largely responsible for the identification of spurious operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and genus-level phylotypes. The number of spurious OTUs and phylotypes increased with sequencing effort indicating that comparison of communities should be made using an equal number of sequences. Finally, we applied our improved quality-filtering pipeline to several benchmarking studies and observed that even with our stringent data curation pipeline, biases in the data generation pipeline and batch effects were observed that could potentially confound the interpretation of microbial community data.},

abstract = {Climate warming threatens to increase mass coral bleaching events, and several studies have projected the demise of tropical coral reefs this century. However, recent evidence indicates corals may be able to respond to thermal stress though adaptive processes (e.g., genetic adaptation, acclimatization, and symbiont shuffling). How these mechanisms might influence warming induced bleaching is largely unknown. This study compared how different adaptive processes could affect coral bleaching~projections. We used the latest bias-corrected global sea surface temperature (SST) output from the NOAA/GFDL Earth System Model 2 (ESM2M) for the pre-industrial period though 2100 to project coral bleaching trajectories. Initial results showed that, in the absence of adaptive processes, application of a pre-industrial climatology to the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method over-predicts the present day bleaching frequency. This suggests that corals may have already responded adaptively to some warming over the industrial period. We then modified the prediction method so that the bleaching threshold either permanently increased in response to thermal history (e.g., simulating directional genetic selection) or temporarily increased for 2-10 years in response to a bleaching event (e.g., simulating symbiont shuffling). A bleaching threshold that changes relative to the preceding 60 years of thermal history reduced the frequency of mass bleaching events by 20-80% compared with the 'no adaptive response' prediction model by 2100, depending on the emissions scenario. When both types of adaptive responses were applied, up to 14% more reef cells avoided high frequency bleaching by 2100. However, temporary increases in bleaching thresholds alone only delayed the occurrence of high frequency bleaching by {\textasciitilde}10 years in all but the lowest emissions scenario. Future research should test the rate and limit of different adaptive responses for coral species across latitudes and ocean basins to determine if and how much corals can respond to increasing thermal stress.

abstract = {Coral bleaching is a significant contributor to the worldwide degradation of coral reefs and is indicative of the termination of symbiosis between the coral host and its symbiotic algae (dinoflagellate; Symbiodinium sp. complex), usually by expulsion or xenophagy (symbiophagy) of its dinoflagellates. Herein, we provide evidence that during the earliest stages of environmentally induced bleaching, heat stress and light stress generate distinctly different pathomorphological changes in the chloroplasts, while a combined heat- and light-stress exposure induces both pathomorphologies; suggesting that these stressors act on the dinoflagellate by different mechanisms. Within the first 48 hours of a heat stress (32{\textdegree}C) under low-light conditions, heat stress induced decomposition of thylakoid structures before observation of extensive oxidative damage; thus it is the disorganization of the thylakoids that creates the conditions allowing photo-oxidative-stress. Conversely, during the first 48 hours of a light stress (2007 {\textmu}moles m(-2) s(-1) PAR) at 25{\textdegree}C, condensation or fusion of multiple thylakoid lamellae occurred coincidently with levels of oxidative damage products, implying that photo-oxidative stress causes the structural membrane damage within the chloroplasts. Exposure to combined heat- and light-stresses induced both pathomorphologies, confirming that these stressors acted on the dinoflagellate via different mechanisms. Within 72 hours of exposure to heat and/or light stresses, homeostatic processes (e.g., heat-shock protein and anti-oxidant enzyme response) were evident in the remaining intact dinoflagellates, regardless of the initiating stressor. Understanding the sequence of events during bleaching when triggered by different environmental stressors is important for predicting both severity and consequences of coral bleaching.},

abstract = {Extreme events, which have profound ecological consequences, are changing in both frequency and magnitude with climate change. Because extreme temperatures induce coral bleaching, we can explore the relative impacts of changes in frequency and magnitude of high temperature events on coral reefs. Here, we combined climate projections and a dynamic population model to determine how changing bleaching regimes influence coral persistence. We additionally explored how coral traits and competition with macroalgae mediate changes in bleaching regimes. Our results predict that severe bleaching events reduce coral persistence more than frequent bleaching. Corals with low adult mortality and high growth rates are successful when bleaching is mild, but bleaching resistance is necessary to persist when bleaching is severe, regardless of frequency. The existence of macroalgae-dominated stable states reduces coral persistence and changes the relative importance of coral traits. Building on previous studies, our results...},

abstract = {The genus Symbiodinium encompasses a group of unicellular, photosynthetic dinoflagellates that are found free living or in hospite with a wide range of marine invertebrate hosts including scleractinian corals. We present GeoSymbio, a hybrid web application that provides an online, easy to use and freely accessible interface for users to discover, explore and utilize global geospatial bioinformatic and ecoinformatic data on Symbiodinium-host symbioses. The novelty of this application lies in the combination of a variety of query and visualization tools, including dynamic searchable maps, data tables with filter and grouping functions, and interactive charts that summarize the data. Importantly, this application is hosted remotely or 'in the cloud' using Google Apps, and therefore does not require any specialty GIS, web programming or data programming expertise from the user. The current version of the application utilizes Symbiodinium data based on the ITS2 genetic marker from PCR-based techniques, including denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, sequencing and cloning of specimens collected during 1982-2010. All data elements of the application are also downloadable as spatial files, tables and nucleic acid sequence files in common formats for desktop analysis. The application provides a unique tool set to facilitate research on the basic biology of Symbiodinium and expedite new insights into their ecology, biogeography and evolution in the face of a changing global climate.

abstract = {Coral bleaching occurs when environmental stress induces breakdown of the coral-algae symbiosis and the host initiates algae expulsion. Two types of coral bleaching had been thoroughly discussed in the scientific literature; the first is primarily associated with mass coral bleaching events; the second is a seasonal loss of algae and/or pigments. Here, we describe a phenomenon that has been witnessed for repeated summers in the mesophotic zone (40-63 m) in the northern Red Sea: seasonal bleaching and recovery of several hermatypic coral species. In this study, we followed the recurring bleaching process of the common coral Stylophora pistillata. Bleaching occurred from April to September with a 66% decline in chlorophyll a concentration, while recovery began in October. Using aquarium and transplantation experiments, we explored environmental factors such as temperature, photon flux density and heterotrophic food availability. Our experiments and observations did not yield one single factor, alone, responsible for the seasonal bleaching. The dinoflagellate symbionts (of the genus Symbiodinium) in shallow (5 m) Stylophora pistillata were found to have a net photosynthetic rate of 56.98-92.19 {\textmu}mol O2 cm(-2) day(-1). However, those from mesophotic depth (60 m) during months when they are not bleached are net consumers of oxygen having a net photosynthetic rate between -12.86 - (-10.24) {\textmu}mol O2 cm(-2) day(-1). But during months when these mesophotic corals are partially-bleached, they yielded higher net production, between -2.83-0.76 {\textmu}mol O2 cm(-2) day(-1). This study opens research questions as to why mesophotic zooxanthellae are more successfully meeting the corals metabolic requirements when Chl a concentration decreases by over 60% during summer and early fall.},

abstract = {Worldwide, many marine coastal habitats are facing rapid deterioration due in part to human-driven changes in habitat characteristics, including changes in flow patterns, a factor known to greatly affect primary production in corals, algae, and seagrasses. The effect of flow traditionally is attributed to enhanced influx of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) across the benthic boundary layer from the water to the organism however, here we report that the organism's photosynthetic response to changes in the flow is nearly instantaneous, and that neither nutrients nor DIC limits this rapid response. Using microelectrodes, dual-pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometry, particle image velocimetry, and real time mass-spectrometry with the common scleractinian coral Favia veroni, the alga Gracilaria cornea, and the seagrass Halophila stipulacea, we show that this augmented photosynthesis is due to flow-driven enhancement of oxygen efflux from the organism to the water, which increases the affinity of the RuBisCO to CO(2). No augmentation of photosynthesis was found in the absence of flow or when flow occurred, but the ambient concentration of oxygen was artificially elevated. We suggest that water motion should be considered a fundamental factor, equivalent to light and nutrients, in determining photosynthesis rates in marine benthic autotrophs.},

abstract = {Symbioses involving arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are among the most important ecological associations for many plant species. The diversity of AMF associated with ferns, however, remains poorly studied. Using recently designed Glomus-specific primers, we surveyed the AMF community associated with ferns from deciduous, broad-leaved second-growth forest habitats at the eastern edge of the piedmont region of central Virginia, USA. Results indicate that this molecular approach may be a useful tool for detecting AMF in ferns compared to traditional techniques based on morphology. Over 30 potential fungal ribotypes were identified from eight fern species using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Fungal ribotypes were found to differ widely in terms of (1) the number of fern partners with which they interact and (2) their relative frequency within each fern. Sequence analysis of fungal isolates from three species of fern indicated that the primers were generally highly specific for Glomus species but some non-target DNA was also amplified. Cloned polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from Polystichum acrostichoides and Osmunda regalis revealed several phylogenetically distinct Glomus species. A single Glomus species was identified in the cloned PCR products from Botrychium virginianum. These findings challenge the hypothesis that the extent or degree of fern-fungal symbiosis is somehow tied to root complexity. Environmental factors appear to influence the suite of AMF that form partnerships with ferns. Some species of fern from similar habitats associated with dissimilar fungal partners (e.g., P. acrostichoides and Athyrium filix-femina var. asplenioides), whereas others harbored uniform fungal communities (e.g., Asplenium platyneuron). The significance of these data in terms of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of the AMF-fern symbiosis is discussed.},

However, similarities between organisms, such as von Bertalanffy's growth curve and Kleiber's law on metabolic rate, suggest that mechanisms that control the uptake and use of metabolites are common to all organisms. These and other widespread empirical patterns in biology should be the ultimate test for any metabolic theory that hopes for generality. The present study (i) collects empirical evidence on growth, stoichiometry, feeding, respiration and energy dissipation and exhibits it as stylized biological facts; (ii) formalizes assumptions and propositions in a metabolic theory that is fully consistent with the Dynamic Energy Budget theory; and (iii) proves that these assumptions and propositions are consistent with the stylized facts.},

abstract = {Only 17% of 111 reef-building coral genera and none of the 18 coral families with reef-builders are considered endemic to the Atlantic, whereas the corresponding percentages for the Indowest Pacific are 76% and 39%(1,2). These figures depend on the assumption that genera and families spanning the two provinces belong to the same lineages ( that is, they are monophyletic). Here we show that this assumption is incorrect on the basis of analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Pervasive morphological convergence at the family level has obscured the evolutionary distinctiveness of Atlantic corals. Some Atlantic genera conventionally assigned to different families are more closely related to each other than they are to their respective Pacific 'congeners'. Nine of the 27 genera of reef-building Atlantic corals belong to this previously unrecognized lineage, which probably diverged over 34 million years ago. Although Pacific reefs have larger numbers of more narrowly distributed species, and therefore rank higher in biodiversity hotspot analyses(3), the deep evolutionary distinctiveness of many Atlantic corals should also be considered when setting conservation priorities.},

abstract = {The photochemical efficiency of symbiotic dinoflagellates within the tissues of two reef-building corals in response to normal and excess irradiance at wafer temperatures < 30 C were investigated using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques, Dark-adapted F-v/F-m showed clear diurnal changes, decreasing to a low at solar noon and increasing in the afternoon. However, F-v/F-m also drifted downwards at night or in prolonged darkness, and increased rapidly during the early morning twilight. This parameter also increased when the oxygen concentration of the wafer holding the corals was increased. Such changes have not been described previously, and most probably reflect state transition's associated with PQ pool reduction via chlororespiration. These unusual characteristics may be a feature of an endosymbiotic environment, reflective of the well-documented night-time tissue hypoxia that occurs in corals. F-v/F-m decreased to 0.25 in response to full sunlight in shade-acclimated (shade) colonies of Stylophora pistillata, which is considerably lower than in light-acclimated (sun) colonies. In sun colonies, the reversible decrease in F-v/F-m was caused by a lowering of F-m and F-o suggesting photoprotection and no lasting damage. The decrease in F-v/F-m, however, was caused by a decrease in F-m and an increase in F-o in shade colonies suggesting photoinactivation and long-term cumulative photoinhibition. Shade colonies rapidly lost their symbiotic algae (bleached) during exposure to full sunlight. This study is consistent with the hypothesis that excess light leads to chronic damage of symbiotic dinoflagellates and their eventual removal from reef-building corals. It is significant that this can occur with high light conditions alone.7862127110348096984085605464763615710333710348097011118095986626423843439327299520750914253902737756273509694025173859512077870847896449342706010121127353128310319710137838848338906770555241112251021127349057028366164904702106056965814250142945385810929651311354219810875962811273545486486414761304279045823610154260896403663877344801185908261185908276812727988390694806632839065631493506634118590828634305481103568246904820010167739684111537101738939923791635996811386072675112405969830377879517296111095577372038568109925446},

Over this time period, domestic fishing effort, as numbers of hooks set in the core Hawaii-based fishing ground, has increased fourfold. The standardized aggregated annual catch rate for 9 small ({\&}lt;15 kg) species increased about 25% while for 14 large species ({\&}gt;15 kg) it decreased about 50% over the 16-year period. A size-based ecosystem model for the subtropical Pacific captures this pattern well as a response to increased fishing effort. Further, the model projects a decline in the abundance of fishes larger than 15 kg results in an increase in abundance of animals from 0.1 to 15 kg but with minimal subsequent cascade to sizes smaller than 0.1 kg. These results suggest that size-based predation plays a key role in structuring the subtropical ecosystem. These changes in ecosystem size structure show up in the fishery in various ways. The non-commercial species lancetfish (mean weight 7 kg) has now surpassed the target species, bigeye tuna, as the species with the highest annual catch rate. Based on the increase in snake mackerel (mean weight 0.8 kg) and lancetfish catches, the discards in the fishery are estimated to have increased from 30 to 40% of the total catch.},

To gain insight into this process, two mesocosm-based experiments were conducted in Southern Taiwan with the model reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis. In the first study, temperature was gradually elevated to 32~{\textdegree}C, though reduced to ambient levels at night, in order to simulate a temperature profile that can characterize intertidal reefs of Southern Taiwan. All corals acclimated to such conditions over the course of the month-long experiment, as evidenced by a variety of physiological and sub-cellular responses. In the second experiment, corals were exposed continually to 31.5~{\textdegree}C for two weeks, and, in contrast to results from the first study, the majority of the corals died, revealing that prolonged exposure to this temperature is lethal for this dominant reef builder of many regions of the Pacific Ocean.},

abstract = {Managing coral reefs for resilience to climate change is a popular concept but has been difficult to implement because the empirical scientific evidence has either not been evaluated or is sometimes unsupportive of theory, which leads to uncertainty when considering methods and identifying priority reefs. We asked experts and reviewed the scientific literature for guidance on the multiple physical and biological factors that affect the ability of coral reefs to resist and recover from climate disturbance. Eleven key factors to inform decisions based on scaling scientific evidence and the achievability of quantifying the factors were identified. Factors important to resistance and recovery, which are important components of resilience, were not strongly related, and should be assessed independently. The abundance of resistant (heat-tolerant) coral species and past temperature variability were perceived to provide the greatest resistance to climate change, while coral recruitment rates, and macroalgae abundance were most influential in the recovery process. Based on the 11 key factors, we tested an evidence-based framework for climate change resilience in an Indonesian marine protected area. The results suggest our evidence-weighted framework improved upon existing un-weighted methods in terms of characterizing resilience and distinguishing priority sites. The evaluation supports the concept that, despite high ecological complexity, relatively few strong variables can be important in influencing ecosystem dynamics. This is the first rigorous assessment of factors promoting coral reef resilience based on their perceived importance, empirical evidence, and feasibility of measurement. There were few differences between scientists' perceptions of factor importance and the scientific evidence found in journal publications but more before and after impact studies will be required to fully test the validity of all the factors. The methods here will increase the feasibility and defensibility of including key resilience metrics in evaluations of coral reefs, as well as reduce costs. Adaptation, marine protected areas, priority setting, resistance, recovery.},

Bleached colonies of the dominant Caribbean reef building species, Montastrea faveolata and Montastrea franksi, were sampled over a depth gradient from 1 to 17 m during this period of elevated temperature and contained lower densities of symbiotic dinoflagellates in deeper corals than seen in previous "nonbleaching" years. Fluorescence analysis by pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometry revealed severe damage to photosystem II. (PSII) in remaining symbionts within the corals, with greater damage indicated at deeper depths. Dinoflagellates with the greatest loss in PSII activity also showed a significant decline in the DI reaction center protein of PSII, as measured by immunoblot analysis. Laboratory experiments on the temperature-sensitive species Montastrea annularis, as well as temperature-sensitive and temperature-tolerant cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates, confirmed the temperature-dependent loss of PSII activity and concomitant decrease in D1 reaction center protein seen in symbionts collected from corals naturally bleached on the reef. In addition, variation in PSII repair was detected, indicating that perturbation of PSII protein turnover rates during photoinhibition at elevated temperatures underlies the physiological collapse of symbionts in corals susceptible to heat-induced bleaching.},

abstract = {Coral photophysiology has been studied intensively from the colony scale down to the scale of single fluorescent pigment granules as light is one of the key determinants for coral health. We studied the photophysiology of the oral and aboral symbiont band of scleractinian coral Montastrea curta to investigate if different acclimation to light exist in hospite on a polyp scale. By combined use of electrochemical and fiber-optic microsensors for O2, scalar irradiance and variable chlorophyll fluorescence, we could characterize the physical and chemical microenvironment experienced by the symbionts and, for the first time, estimate effective quantum yields of PSII photochemistry and rates of electron transport at the position of the zooxanthellae corrected for the in-tissue gradient of scalar irradiance. The oral- and aboral Symbiodinium layers received {\textasciitilde}71% and {\textasciitilde}33% of surface scalar irradiance, respectively, and the two symbiont layers experience considerable differences in light exposure. Rates of gross photosynthesis did not differ markedly between the oral- and aboral layer and curves of PSII electron transport rates corrected for scalar irradiance in hospite, showed that the light use efficiency under sub-saturating light conditions were similar between the two layers. However, the aboral Symbiodinium band did not experience photosynthetic saturation, even at the highest investigated irradiance where the oral layer was clearly saturated. We thus found a different light acclimation response for the oral and aboral symbiont bands in hospite, and discuss whether such response could be shaped by spectral shifts caused by tissue gradients of scalar irradiance. Based on our experimental finding, combined with previous knowledge, we present a conceptual model on the photophysiology of Symbiodinium residing inside living coral tissue under natural gradients of light and chemical parameters.},

Its habitat, the deepest layer of Lake Bonney in Antarctica, features low irradiance, low temperature, and high salinity. Although psychrophily and low-light acclimation of this green alga has been described, very little information is available on the effect of salinity. Here, we demonstrate that this psychrophile is halotolerant, not halophilic, and it shows energy redistribution between photosystem I and II based on energy spillover under low-salt conditions. Furthermore, we revealed that C. raudensis exhibits higher non-photochemical quenching in comparison with the mesophile Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, when grown with low-salt, which is due to the lower proton conductivity across the thylakoid membrane. Significance of the C. raudensis UWO241 traits found in the low salinity culture are implicated with their natural habitats, including the high salinity and extremely stable light environments.},

abstract = {Internal and external feeding on zooplankton may provide scleractinian corals with important nutrients. However, the latter process has never been properly quantified. To quantify the dynamics of zooplankton capture, digestion and release for a scleractinian coral, we performed detailed video analyses of Galaxea fascicularis feeding on Artemia nauplii. A highly dynamic process of prey capture, digestion and release was observed. A single G. fascicularis polyp (N=3) captured 558{\textpm}67 and released 383{\textpm}75 Artemia nauplii over a 6 h interval. On average, 98.6% of prey captured was not ingested. Instead, prey items were clustered into aggregates that were digested externally by mesenterial filaments. In addition, we employed carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus analysis of zooplankton before and after digestion by G. fascicularis colonies (N=6). For total organic carbon, 43.1% (0.298{\textpm}0.148 $\mu$g Artemia(-1)) was lost after 6 h of digestion. For total organic nitrogen, total organic phosphorus and orthophosphate (PO(4)(3-)), these values were 51.3% (0.059{\textpm}0.028 $\mu$g Artemia(-1)), 50.9% (0.009{\textpm}0.004 $\mu$g Artemia(-1)) and 84.6% (0.0019{\textpm}0.0008 $\mu$g Artemia(-1)), respectively. For extracoelenteric zooplankton feeding alone, total estimated nutrient inputs for G. fascicularis colonies were 76.5{\textpm}0.0 $\mu$g organic carbon, 15.2{\textpm}0.0 $\mu$g organic nitrogen, 2.3{\textpm}0.2 $\mu$g organic phosphorus and 0.5{\textpm}0.8 $\mu$g inorganic phosphorus per cm(2) coral tissue per day. These values exceed calculations based on intracoelenteric feeding by up to two orders of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that extracoelenteric zooplankton feeding is a key mechanism of nutrient acquisition for a scleractinian coral. These results are of importance to coral aquaculture and our understanding of benthic-pelagic coupling on coral reefs.},

abstract = {Millions of people rely on the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs, but sustaining these benefits requires an understanding of how reefs and their biotic communities are affected by local human-induced disturbances and global climate change. Ecosystem-based management that explicitly considers the indirect and cumulative effects of multiple disturbances has been recommended and adopted in policies in many places around the globe. Ecosystem models give insight into complex reef dynamics and their responses to multiple disturbances and are useful tools to support planning and implementation of ecosystem-based management. We adapted the Atlantis Ecosystem Model to incorporate key dynamics for a coral reef ecosystem around Guam in the tropical western Pacific. We used this model to quantify the effects of predicted climate and ocean changes and current levels of current land-based sources of pollution (LBSP) and fishing. We used the following six ecosystem metrics as indicators of ecosystem state, resilience and harvest potential: 1) ratio of calcifying to non-calcifying benthic groups, 2) trophic level of the community, 3) biomass of apex predators, 4) biomass of herbivorous fishes, 5) total biomass of living groups and 6) the end-to-start ratio of exploited fish groups. Simulation tests of the effects of each of the three drivers separately suggest that by mid-century climate change will have the largest overall effect on this suite of ecosystem metrics due to substantial negative effects on coral cover. The effects of fishing were also important, negatively influencing five out of the six metrics. Moreover, LBSP exacerbates this effect for all metrics but not quite as badly as would be expected under additive assumptions, although the magnitude of the effects of LBSP are sensitive to uncertainty associated with primary productivity. Over longer time spans (i.e., 65 year simulations), climate change impacts have a slight positive interaction with other drivers, generally meaning that declines in ecosystem metrics are not as steep as the sum of individual effects of the drivers. These analyses offer one way to quantify impacts and interactions of particular stressors in an ecosystem context and so provide guidance to managers. For example, the model showed that improving water quality, rather than prohibiting fishing, extended the timescales over which corals can maintain high abundance by at least 5{\textendash}8 years. This result, in turn, provides more scope for corals to adapt or for resilient species to become established and for local and global management efforts to reduce or reverse stressors.},

abstract = {To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms through which a chemical exerts toxicity, a deeper insight is needed regarding the physiological processes that take place during a toxic stress. This issue can have important benefits for risk assessment, because it can contribute to a better interpretation of toxicity data. Here, we study the physiological mode of action of three different compounds (cadmium, carbendazim, and pentachlorobenzene) with an experimental data-based approach using whole life-cycle toxicity data from the nematode Acrobeloides nanus. We use a process-based model, based on the dynamic energy budget theory, to study the fluxes of energy related to physiological processes and their variation throughout the life cycle. With this approach, we unravel the physiological modes of action based on resource allocation, and we model the effects of the different modes of action at the population level. The mode of action of carbendazim was through a decrease in assimilation, with an additional effect on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cadmium increased the costs of growth, with an extra effect on ROS production, and pentachlorobenzene decreased assimilation. We compared the present results with those of previous studies using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and we found that the modes of action for the three compounds differed from those found in A. nanus, showing that the life-history characteristics of each organism have a clear influence on the resulting modes of action. This highlights the importance of the interactions between a chemical and the biological characteristics of the organism in determination of the resulting physiological modes of action.},

abstract = {Baleen whales (Mysticeti) communicate using low-frequency acoustic signals. These long-wavelength sounds can be detected over hundreds of kilometres, potentially allowing contact over large distances. Low-frequency noise from large ships (20-200 Hz) overlaps acoustic signals used by baleen whales, and increased levels of underwater noise have been documented in areas with high shipping traffic. Reported responses of whales to increased noise include: habitat displacement, behavioural changes and alterations in the intensity, frequency and intervals of calls. However, it has been unclear whether exposure to noise results in physiological responses that may lead to significant consequences for individuals or populations. Here, we show that reduced ship traffic in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, following the events of 11 September 2001, resulted in a 6 dB decrease in underwater noise with a significant reduction below 150 Hz. This noise reduction was associated with decreased baseline levels of stress-related faecal hormone metabolites (glucocorticoids) in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). This is the first evidence that exposure to low-frequency ship noise may be associated with chronic stress in whales, and has implications for all baleen whales in heavy ship traffic areas, and for recovery of this endangered right whale population.},

abstract = {Scleractinian corals experience a wide range of flow regimes which, coupled with colony morphology, can affect the ability of corals to capture zooplankton and other particulate materials. We used a field enclosure oriented parallel to prevailing oscillatory flow on the forereef at Discovery Bay, Jamaica, to investigate rates of zooplankton capture by corals of varying morphology and polyp size under realistic flow speeds. Experiments were carried out from 1989 to 1992. Particles (Artemia salina cysts) and naturally occurring zooplankton attracted into the enclosures were used as prey for the corals Madracis Mirabilis (Duchassaing and Michelotti) (narrow branches, small polyps), Montastrea cavernosa (Linnaeus) (mounding, large polyps), and Porites porites (Pallas) (wide branches, small polyps). This design allowed corals to be used without removing them or their prey from the reef environment, and avoided contact of zooplankton with net surfaces.]Flow speed had significant effects on capture rate for cysts (M. mirabilis), total zooplankton (M. mirabilis, M. cavernosa), and non-copepod zooplankton (M. mirabilis). Zooplankton prey capture increased with prey concentration for M. mirabilis and M. cavernosa, over a broad range of concentrations, indicating that saturation of the feeding response had not occurred until prey density was over 10(4) items m(-3), a concentration at least an order of magnitude greater than the normal range of reef zooplankton concentrations. Location of cyst capture on coral surfaces was not uniform; for M. cavernosa, sides and tops of mounds captured most particles, and for P. porites, capture was greatest near branch tops, but was close to uniform for M. mirabilis branches in all flow conditions. The present study confirms laboratory flume results, and field results for other species, suggesting that many coral species experience particle flux and encounter rate limitations at low flow speeds, decreasing potential zooplankton capture rates.},

abstract = {Background The Gaussian or normal distribution is the most established model to characterize quantitative variation of original data. Accordingly, data are summarized using the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation, by {\textpm} SD, or with the standard error of the mean, {\textpm} SEM. This, together with corresponding bars in graphical displays has become the standard to characterize variation. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we question the adequacy of this characterization, and of the model. The published literature provides numerous examples for which such descriptions appear inappropriate because, based on the {\textquotedblleft}95% range check{\textquotedblright}, their distributions are obviously skewed. In these cases, the symmetric characterization is a poor description and may trigger wrong conclusions. To solve the problem, it is enlightening to regard causes of variation. Multiplicative causes are by far more important than additive ones, in general, and benefit from a multiplicative (or log-) normal approach. Fortunately, quite similar to the normal, the log-normal distribution can now be handled easily and characterized at the level of the original data with the help of both, a new sign, x /, times-divide, and notation. Analogous to {\textpm} SD, it connects the multiplicative (or geometric) mean * and the multiplicative standard deviation s* in the form * x / s* , that is advantageous and recommended. Conclusions/Significance The corresponding shift from the symmetric to the asymmetric view will substantially increase both, recognition of data distributions, and interpretation quality. It will allow for savings in sample size that can be considerable. Moreover, this is in line with ethical responsibility. Adequate models will improve concepts and theories, and provide deeper insight into science and life.},

The composition of the vertebrate gut microbiota is influenced by diet, host morphology and phylogeny, and in this respect the human gut bacterial community is typical of an omnivorous primate. However, the vertebrate gut microbiota is different from free-living communities that are not associated with animal body habitats. We propose that the recently initiated international Human Microbiome Project should strive to include a broad representation of humans, as well as other mammalian and environmental samples, as comparative analyses of microbiotas and their microbiomes are a powerful way to explore the evolutionary history of the biosphere.},

abstract = {Worldwide, the seleractinian corals that characterize contemporary coral reef communities are exhibiting, a variety of pathological conditions. These conditions range from diseases linked with specific pathogens to the syndrome known as bleaching. The latter phenomenon involves the loss or reduction of the symbiotic zooxanthellae on which the corals depend. Bleaching appears to be a generalized stress syndrome, but in some cases it may be due to pathogenic infections. A full understanding of coral pathologies requires the development of laboratory models. We have developed two complementary protocols that will facilitate the study of coral pathologies at a number of levels. The first method involves the induction of bleaching by exposing the coral to an acute period of reduced temperature. The second protocol allows the dissociation of coral polyps into a number of cell types that can be maintained long-term in primary Culture. Among these are multicellular endothelial isolates (MEI) that contain zooxanthellae and show a high rate of motility. The bleaching protocol will enable investigators to study the processes by which corals recover from bleaching, and it will offer a standard that can be compared to other conditions that lead to bleaching. The cell culture technique will enable the study of mechanisms underlying pathological conditions at the cellular level, and permit studies of how, pathological conditions disrupt the relationship between corals and their zooxanthellae.},

abstract = {Thermal resistance of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis has been associated with chronic photoinhibition, increased antioxidant activity and protein repair involving high demands of nitrogen and energy. While the relative importance of heterotrophy as a source of nutrients and energy for cnidarian hosts, and as a means of nitrogen acquisition for their zooxanthellae, is well documented, the effect of feeding on the thermal sensitivity of the symbiotic association has been so far overlooked. Here we examine the effect of zooplankton feeding versus starvation on the bleaching susceptibility and photosynthetic activity of photosystem II (PSII) of zooxanthellae in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata in response to thermal stress (daily temperature rises of 2-3 degrees C) over 10 days, employing pulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll fluorometry. Fed and starved corals displayed a decrease in daily maximum potential quantum yield (F (v)/F (m)) of PSII, effective quantum yield (F/F (m)') and relative electron transport rates over the course of 10 days. However after 10 days of exposure to elevated temperature, F (v)/F (m) of fed corals was still 50-70% higher than F (v)/F (m) of starved corals. Starved corals showed strong signs of chronic photoinhibition, which was reflected in a significant decline in nocturnal recovery rates of PSII relative to fed corals. This was paralleled by the progressive inability to dissipate excess excitation energy via non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). After 10 days, NPQ of starved corals had decreased by about 80% relative to fed corals. Feeding treatment had no significant effect on chlorophyll a and c (2) concentrations and zooxanthellae densities, but the mitotic indices were significantly lower in starved than in fed corals. Collectively the results indicate that exogenous food may reduce the photophysiological damage of zooxanthellae that typically leads to bleaching and could therefore play an important role in mediating the thermal resistance of some corals.},

abstract = {Suspended particulate matter (SPM) strongly alters the trophic environment of photosymbiotic aquatic organisms. At high particles loads, phototrophic energy gains can be diminished due to light absorption by suspended particles, and stress from particle abrasion or deposition on tissues. However, energy gains are enhanced if organisms are able to use SPM as a food source. For photosymbiotic benthic suspension feeders, increases in SPM concentrations may require both phototrophic and heterotrophic acclimation to sustain a positive energy balance. This study provides an experimental analysis of the effects of contrasting light and SPM regimes on the energy budget (scope for growth) of two zooxanthellate corals (Goniastrea retiformis and Porites cylindrica). Using a factorial design in a flow-through tank system, corals were exposed for 2 months to shaded and unshaded conditions (equivalent to 3-4 m depth at 4 and 16 mg dry weight SPM l(-1), respectively) and a range of controlled SPM loads with a natural organic content ( approximately 3% w/w). In G. retiformis, rates of particle ingestion were a linear function of SPM concentration within a broad range (1-30 mg dry weight l(-1)). After 2 months of shading, photosynthetic acclimation was significant in G. retiformis, but did not compensate for the reduced light level, as daily respiration exceeded daily photosynthesis. However, in response to the prolonged shading, G. retiformis more than doubled its rate of particle feeding. At high SPM treatments (16 mg dw l(-1)), sediment feeding by this species compensated fully for the 35-47% lower phototrophy in the shaded treatment. Due to both photo- and heterotrophic plasticity, G. retiformis gained tissue and skeletal mass at all experimental levels of light and SPM. In contrast, rates of particle intake by P. cylindrica contributed <10% to the energy budget in shaded and <3% in unshaded conditions. Feeding rates of P. cylindrica were half-saturated at approximately 3 mg dry weight l(-1), and four- to eight-fold lower than those of G. retiformis. Skeletal growth was sustained, but tissue mass and lipid contents declined in shaded and high-SPM treatments, and carbon loss due to shading by SPM was not compensated for by particle feeding. Thus, due to a lack of photo- and heterotrophic plasticity, periods of high turbidity resulted in energy deficiency in P. cylindrica, and high turbidity conditions appeared physiologically unsustainable for this species. This study is the first to show heterotrophic plasticity in a symbiotic coral, and to show that such plasticity can offset stress from high particle loads. It demonstrates that changes in the trophic mode of some coral species are a mechanism for sustaining a positive energy balance in turbid environments, thereby broadening their physiological niche.},

abstract = {We sequenced the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) of Symbiodinium spp. (Freudenthal) from conspecific Zoanthus sansibaricus (Carlgren) colonies along a latitudinal gradient in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that Zoanthus in the two northern sites of Kokubu and Sakurajima harbor exclusively Symbiodinium subclade C1, whereas Yakushima Zoanthus harbors Symbiodinium subclades C1 and C15, and southernmost Amami Zoanthus Symbiodinium subclades A1 and C1, indicating holobiont flexibility. Individual Zoanthus colonies associated exclusively with one single subclade, but unexpectedly there was small variation between Symbiodinium ITS-rDNA clone sequences obtained from within individual Zoanthus colonies. There was also a large deletion in the ITS-2/28S rDNA boundary region in one clone sequence, and another large deletion in the 5.8S rDNA region in another clone. Our intracolony sequence heterogeneity might be a result of the presence of multiple copies of the ITS-rDNA region within individual Symbiodinium genomes, or result from the possible presence of closely related Symbiodinium genotypes in the host.},

abstract = {The light-harvesting complex (LHC) is an essential component in light energy capture and transduction to facilitate downstream photosynthetic reactions in plant and algal chloroplasts. The unicellular dinoflagellate alga Symbiodinium is an endosymbiont of cnidarian animals, including corals and sea anemones, and provides carbohydrates generated through photosynthesis to host animals. Although Symbiodinium possesses a unique LHC gene family, called chlorophyll a -chlorophyll c 2 -peridinin protein complex (acpPC), its genome-level diversity and evolutionary trajectories have not been investigated. Here, we describe a phylogenetic analysis revealing that many of the LHCs are encoded by highly duplicated genes with multi-subunit polyprotein structures in the nuclear genome of Symbiodinium minutum . This analysis provides an extended list of the LHC gene family in a single organism, including 80 loci encoding polyproteins composed of 145 LHC subunits recovered in the phylogenetic tree. In S . minutum , 5 phylogenetic groups of the Lhcf -type gene family, which is exclusively conserved in algae harboring secondary plastids of red algal origin, were identified. Moreover, 5 groups of the Lhcr -type gene family, of which members are known to be associated with PSI in red algal plastids and secondary plastids of red algal origin, were identified. Notably, members classified within a phylogenetic group of the Lhcf -type (group F1) are highly duplicated, which may explain the presence of an unusually large number of LHC genes in this species. Some gene units were homologous to other units within single loci of the polyprotein genes, whereas intergenic homologies between separate loci were conspicuous in other cases, implying that gene unit {\textquoteleft}shuffling{\textquoteright} by gene conversion and/or genome rearrangement might have been a driving force for diversification. These results suggest that vigorous intra- and intergenic gene duplication events have resulted in the genomic framework of photosynthesis in coral symbiont dinoflagellate algae.},

abstract = {Symbiotic associations often enhance hosts' physiological capabilities, allowing them to expand into restricted terrains, thus leading to biological diversification. Stable maintenance of partners is essential for the overall biological system to succeed. The viviparous tsetse fly (Diptera: Glossinidae) offers an exceptional system to examine factors that influence the maintenance of multiple symbiotic organisms within a single eukaryotic host. This insect harbours three different symbionts representing diverse associations, coevolutionary histories and transmission modes. The enterics, obligate mutualist Wigglesworthia and beneficial Sodalis, are maternally transmitted to the intrauterine larvae, while parasitic Wolbachia infects the developing oocyte. In this study, the population dynamics of these three symbionts were examined through host development and during potentially disruptive events, including host immune challenge, the presence of third parties (such as African trypanosomes) and environmental perturbations (such as fluctuating humidity levels). While mutualistic partners exhibited well-regulated density profiles over different host developmental stages, parasitic Wolbachia infections varied in individual hosts. Host immune status and the presence of trypanosome infections did not impact the steady-state density levels observed for mutualistic microbes in either sex, while these factors resulted in an increase in Wolbachia density in males. Interestingly, perturbation of the maternal environment resulted in the deposition of progeny harbouring greater overall symbiont loads. The regulation of symbiont density, arising from coadaptive processes, may be an important mechanism driving inter-specific relations to ensure their competitive survival and to promote specialization of beneficial associations.},

However, the development of the probe-independent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach has begun to revolutionize transcriptomics. Here, we assess the feasibility of taking transcriptomics one step further by performing 'dual RNA-seq', in which gene expression changes in both the pathogen and the host are analysed simultaneously.},

abstract = {Temperature-induced bleaching in symbiotic cnidarians is a result of the detachment and loss of host cells containing symbiotic algae. We tested the hypothesis that host cell detachment is evoked through a membrane thermotropic event causing an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+](i), which could then cause collapse of the cytoskeleton and perturb cell adhesion. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of plasma membranes from the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the Hawaiian coral Pocillopora damicornis labeled with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) revealed no membrane thermotropic event. In addition, intracellular imaging using Fura-2AM as well as labeling anemones with Ca-45 revealed no significant change in [Ca2+](i). However, bleaching could be evoked at ambient temperature with 25 mmoll(-1) caffeine without affecting [Ca2+](i). [Ca2+](i) could be altered with ionomycin in isolated host cells, but ionomycin could not induce bleaching in A. pulchella. As caffeine can affect levels of intracellular protein phosphorylation, the ability of other agents that alter intracellular levels of protein phosphorylation to evoke bleaching was investigated. The protein phosphatase inhibitor vanadate could induce bleaching in A. pulchella. Two-dimensional gels of P-32-labeled proteins from cold-shocked, caffeine-treated and control anemones show that both temperature shock and caffeine alter the array of phosphorylated host soluble proteins. We conclude that enidarian bleaching is linked to a temperature-induced alteration in protein phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Over the past three decades, massive bleaching events of zooxanthellate corals have been documented across the range of global distribution. Although the phenomenon is correlated with relatively small increases in sea-surface temperature and enhanced light intensity, the underlying physiological mechanism remains unknown. In this article we demonstrate that thylakoid membrane lipid composition is a key determinate of thermal-stress sensitivity in symbiotic algae of cnidarians. Analyses of thylakoid membranes reveal that the critical threshold temperature separating thermally tolerant from sensitive species of zooxanthellae is determined by the saturation of the lipids. The lipid composition is potentially diagnostic of the differential nature of thermally induced bleaching found in scleractinian corals. Measurements of variable chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic transients indicate that thermally damaged membranes are energetically uncoupled but remain capable of splitting water. Consequently, a fraction of the photosynthetically produced oxygen is reduced by photosystem I through the Mehler reaction to form reactive oxygen species, which rapidly accumulate at high irradiance levels and trigger death and expulsion of the endosymbiotic algae. Differential sensitivity to thermal stress among the various species of Symbiodinium seems to be distributed across all clades. A clocked molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolutionary history of symbiotic algae in cnidarians selected for a reduced tolerance to elevated temperatures in the latter portion of the Cenozoic.},

Here we describe a scalable, highly parallel sequencing system with raw throughput significantly greater than that of state-of-the-art capillary electrophoresis instruments. The apparatus uses a novel fibre-optic slide of individual wells and is able to sequence 25 million bases, at 99% or better accuracy, in one four-hour run. To achieve an approximately 100-fold increase in throughput over current Sanger sequencing technology, we have developed an emulsion method for DNA amplification and an instrument for sequencing by synthesis using a pyrosequencing protocol optimized for solid support and picolitre-scale volumes. Here we show the utility, throughput, accuracy and robustness of this system by shotgun sequencing and de novo assembly of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome with 96% coverage at 99.96% accuracy in one run of the machine.},

Using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, we compared the bacterial communities of red and orange color morphs of the Hawaiian coral, Montipora capitata. Although both color morphs shared dominant bacterial genera, weighted and unweighted UniFrac analysis showed distinct bacterial communities. A single OTU, classified as Vibrio, represented the biggest driver of differences between the color morphs. This OTU was 35.4% ({\textpm} 5.5) of the orange morph bacterial community, yet was 1.1% ({\textpm} 0.6) of the red morph bacterial community. Cultivable bacteria from the two color morphs were also compared and tested for antibacterial activity. Cultured isolates represented 14 genera (7% of total genera identified from sequencing data) and all but two cultured isolates had a matching OTU from sequencing data. Half of the isolates tested (8 out of 16) displayed antibacterial activity against other cultured isolates but not against two known bacterial pathogens of M. capitata. The results from this study demonstrate that the specificity of coral-bacterial associations extends beyond the level of coral species. In addition, culture-dependent methods captured bacterial diversity that was representative of both rare and abundant members of the associated bacterial community, as characterized by culture independent methods.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing platforms have revolutionised our ability to investigate the microbiota composition of complex environments, frequently through 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial component of the community. Numerous factors, including DNA extraction method, primer sequences and sequencing platform employed, can affect the accuracy of the results achieved. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of these three factors on 16S rRNA gene sequencing results, using mock communities and mock community DNA. The use of different primer sequences (V4-V5, V1-V2 and V1-V2 degenerate primers) resulted in differences in the genera and species detected. The V4-V5 primers gave the most comparable results across platforms. The three Ion PGM primer sets detected more of the 20 mock community species than the equivalent MiSeq primer sets. Data generated from DNA extracted using the 2 extraction methods were very similar. Microbiota compositional data differed depending on the primers and sequencing platform that were used. The results demonstrate the risks in comparing data generated using different sequencing approaches and highlight the merits of choosing a standardised approach for sequencing in situations where a comparison across multiple sequencing runs is required.},

abstract = {Photoinhibition may constitute an energetic cost for photosynthetic organisms through damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, or by increased metabolism due to damage avoidance or repair. For several species of scleractinian corals, fluorescence techniques have revealed a significant reduction in photochemical efficiency of symbiotic dinoflagellates within coral tissue in response to excess light absorption. To date, it has been unclear whether or not photoinhibition has a negative impact on energy budgets in corals. We simultaneously quantified the effect of exposure to excessive light on net rates of photosynthesis and on fluorescence-derived photochemistry. We acclimated colonies of the reef-building coral Turbinaria mesenterina to 3 different irradiance regimes in the laboratory. The corals were then exposed to light levels up to 10 times higher than their acclimation irradiance and assayed for rates of photosynthesis and photochemical yields. Results indicated that daily costs of photoinhibition are negligible. Reduced net rates of photosynthesis in the afternoon, compared to the morning, were predominantly due to enhanced afternoon rates of dark respiration. However, photoacclimation to high light levels reduces daily energy acquisition in the long term, primarily due to decreased chlorophyll concentrations. Therefore, although changes in the photosynthetic activity of symbiotic dinoflagellates over a diurnal irradiance cycle do not cause a measurable decline in net oxygen evolution for coral colonies, repeated exposure to excessive irradiance can reduce energy acquisition per unit surface area, and hence influence the upper limit of the depth distribution of scleractinian corals.},

The initiation of this symbiosis was studied using the Red-Sea soft coral Heteroxenia fuscescens. Results show that the motile algal cells are attracted to chemical substances emanating from the mouths of juvenile (zooxanthellae-free) polyps but not of adult (zooxanthellae-bearing) ones. The oral acquisition of symbionts is immediate; within 15 min of encountering the polyp, 15.6 +/- 5.2 cells gain access into it. Once initial acquisition is concluded, the net number of algae within the polyp does not change significantly over the next 3 h, while algae continue to penetrate through and be expelled from the polyp mouth.},

Mombasa corals experienced a greater temperature anomaly than those on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) sites and this was reflected in the greater BMI response of most taxa. Comparing coral taxa in different sites at the same depth produced high correlation coefficients in the bleaching response in Kenya at 2 m (r=0.86) and GBR at 6 m depth sites (r=0.80) but less in the GBR for shallow 2 m sites (r=0.49). The pattern of taxa susceptibility was remarkably consistent between the regions. Coral taxa explained 52% of the variation in the response of colonies to bleaching between these two regions (Kenya BMI=0.90 GBR BMI+26; F(1,19) - 18.3; p < 0.001; r2 = 0.52). Stylophora and Pocillopora were consistently susceptible while Cyphastrea, Goniopora Galaxea and Pavona were resistant in both regions. Three taxa behaved differently between the two regions; Acropora, and branching Porites were both moderately affected on the GBR but were highly affected in Kenya while the opposite was true for Pavona. These results suggest that a colonies response to bleaching is phylogenetically constrained, emphasizing the importance of features of the host's physiology or morphology in determining the response to thermal stress.},

abstract = {Cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses are widespread in the marine environment. Growing concern over the health of coral reef ecosystems has revealed a fundamental lack of knowledge of how cnidarian-algal associations are regulated at the cellular and molecular level. We are interested in identifying genes that mediate interactions between the partners, and we are using the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima as a model. We previously described a host gene, sym32, encoding a fasciclin domain protein, that is differentially expressed in symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. elegantissima. Here, we describe the subcellular localization of the sym32 protein. In aposymbiotic (symbiont-free) hosts, sym32 was located in vesicles that occur along the apical edges of gastrodermal cells. In symbiotic hosts, such vesicles were absent, but sym32 was present within the symbiosome membranes. Sym32 (or a cross-reactive protein) was also present in the accumulation bodies of the symbionts. Although the anti-sym32 antiserum was not sufficiently specific to detect the target protein in cultured Symbiodinium bermudense cells, Western blots of proteins from two Symbiodinium species revealed a protein doublet of 45 and 48 kDa, suggesting that the symbionts may also produce a fasciclin domain protein. We suggest that host sym32 is relocated from gastrodermal vesicles to the symbiosome membrane when symbionts are taken into host cells by phagocytosis.},

abstract = {In the western Pacific during 1998, coral bleaching, or the paling of corals through loss of pigmentation or loss of symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), coincided with some of the warmest sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) on record. However, there was considerable spatial variation in coral survivorship; for example, corals of the same species at different locations around the Ryukyu Islands (Japan), within kilometers of each other, showed vastly different responses. Some locations experienced 100% coral mortality while other locations, nearby, suffered little coral mortality. Here we show experimental evidence for high survivorship of Acropora digitifera coral colonies that were subjected to both high SSTs (ranging from 26.22 to 33.65 degreesC) and high-water flow (50 to 70 cm s(-1)), while corals that were subjected to both high SSTs and low-water now (2 to 3 cm s(-1)) showed low survivorship. All experiments were conducted under high irradiance (similar to 95% photosynthetically active radiation). We also empirically show that no coral mortality occurred when SSTs were below 30 degreesC (ranging from 26.64 to 29.74 degreesC) under similar flow regimes. The spatial differences in coral mortality during the 1998 bleaching event may have been, in part, a result of differences in water-flow rates that induced differential rates of passive diffusion, which varied among habitats.},

abstract = {The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Here, the additional role of poor water quality in lowering the thermal tolerance (i.e. bleaching 'resistance') of symbiotic reef corals is considered. In particular, a quantitative linkage is established between terrestrially-sourced dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) loading and the upper thermal bleaching thresholds of inshore reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Significantly, this biophysical linkage provides concrete evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of corals reefs to global climate change. Indeed, for inshore reef areas with a high runoff exposure risk, it is shown that the potential benefit of this 'local' management imperative is equivalent to approximately 2.0-2.5 degrees C in relation to the upper thermal bleaching limit; though in this case, a potentially cost-prohibitive reduction in end-of-river DIN of >50-80% would be required. An integrated socio-economic modelling framework is outlined that will assist future efforts to understand (optimise) the alternate tradeoffs that the water quality/coral bleaching linkage presents.},

abstract = {Host and symbiont often conflict over patterns of symbiont transmission. Symbionts favour dispersal out of the host to avoid competition with close relatives. Migration leads to competition among different symbiotic lineages, with potentially virulent side-effects on the host. The hosts are favoured to restrict symbiont migration and reduce the virulent tendencies of the symbionts. Reduced mixing of symbionts would, in many cases, lower symbiont virulence and increase the mean fitness of the host population. But a host modifier allele that reduced symbiont mixing increases only when directly associated with reduced virulence. The association between modifiers and reduced virulence depends on the particular details of symbiont biology. The importance of this direct association between modifier and virulence was first noted by Hoekstra (1987) when studying the evolution of uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic elements. I apply Hoekstra's insight to a wide range of host-symbiont life histories, expanding the scope beyond cytoplasmic inheritance and genomic conflict. My comparison of differing symbiont life histories leads to a careful analysis of the conditions under which hosts are favoured to control mixing of their symbionts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Cnidarian-dinoflagellate intracellular symbioses are one of the most important mutualisms in the marine environment. They form the trophic and structural foundation of coral reef ecosystems, and have played a key role in the evolutionary radiation and biodiversity of cnidarian species. Despite the prevalence of these symbioses, we still know very little about the molecular modulators that initiate, regulate, and maintain the interaction between these two different biological entities. In this study, we conducted a comparative host anemone transcriptome analysis using a cDNA microarray platform to identify genes involved in cnidarian-algal symbiosis.

RESULTS:We detected statistically significant differences in host gene expression profiles between sea anemones (Anthopleura elegantissima) in a symbiotic and non-symbiotic state. The group of genes, whose expression is altered, is diverse, suggesting that the molecular regulation of the symbiosis is governed by changes in multiple cellular processes. In the context of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses, we discuss pivotal host gene expression changes involved in lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress.

CONCLUSION:Our data do not support the existence of symbiosis-specific genes involved in controlling and regulating the symbiosis. Instead, it appears that the symbiosis is maintained by altering expression of existing genes involved in vital cellular processes. Specifically, the finding of key genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis have led us to hypothesize that a suppression of apoptosis, together with a deregulation of the host cell cycle, create a platform that might be necessary for symbiont and/or symbiont-containing host cell survival. This first comprehensive molecular examination of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations provides critical insights into the maintenance and regulation of the symbiosis.},

Skeletal growth of P. eydouxi showed environmental but not genetic effects, resulting in doubling of growth in Pool 300 compared with Pool 400. There were no environmental or genetic effects on skeletal growth of P. lobata. Pool 300 had more frequent and longer durations of elevated seawater temperatures than Pool 400, characteristics likely to decrease rather than increase skeletal growth. Pool 300 also had higher nutrient levels and flow velocities than Pool 400, characteristics that may increase skeletal growth. However, higher nutrient levels would be expected to increase skeletal growth in both species, but there was no difference between the pools in P. lobata growth. P. eydouxi is much more common in high-energy environments than P. lobata,; thus the higher flow velocities in Pool 300 than in Pool 400 may have positively affected skeletal growth of P. eydouxi while not having a detectable effect on P. lobata. The greater skeletal growth of P. eydouxi in Pool 300 occurred despite the presence of clade D zooxanthellae in several source colonies in Pool 300, a genotype known to result in greater heat resistance but slower skeletal growth. Increased skeletal growth rates in higher water motion may provide P. eydouxi a competitive advantage in shallow, high-energy environments where competition for space is intense.},

In order to expedite this field of research, we generated and analyzed a collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida and its dinoflagellate symbiont (Symbiodinium sp.), a system that is gaining popularity as a model to study cellular, molecular, and genomic questions related to cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses.

RESULTS:A set of 4,925 unique sequences (UniSeqs) comprising 1,427 clusters of 2 or more ESTs (contigs) and 3,498 unclustered ESTs (singletons) was generated by analyzing 10,285 high-quality ESTs from a mixed host/symbiont cDNA library. Using a BLAST-based approach to predict which unique sequences derived from the host versus symbiont genomes, we found that the contribution of the symbiont genome to the transcriptome was surprisingly small (1.6-6.4%). This may reflect low levels of gene expression in the symbionts, low coverage of alveolate genes in the sequence databases, a small number of symbiont cells relative to the total cellular content of the anemones, or failure to adequately lyse symbiont cells. Furthermore, we were able to identify groups of genes that are known or likely to play a role in cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses, including oxidative stress pathways that emerged as a prominent biological feature of this transcriptome. All ESTs and UniSeqs along with annotation results and other tools have been made accessible through the implementation of a publicly accessible database named AiptasiaBase.

CONCLUSION:We have established the first large-scale transcriptomic resource for Aiptasia pallida and its dinoflagellate symbiont. These data provide researchers with tools to study questions related to cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses on a molecular, cellular, and genomic level. This groundwork represents a crucial step towards the establishment of a tractable model system that can be utilized to better understand cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses. With the advent of next-generation sequencing methods, the transcriptomic inventory of A. pallida and its symbiont, and thus the extent of AiptasiaBase, should expand dramatically in the near future.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that corals can acclimatize or adapt to local stress factors through differential regulation of their gene expression. Profiling gene expression in corals from diverse environments can elucidate the physiological processes that may be responsible for maximizing coral fitness in their natural habitat and lead to a better understanding of the coral's capacity to survive the effects of global climate change. In an accompanying paper, we show that Porites astreoides from thermally different reef habitats exhibit distinct physiological responses when exposed to 6~weeks of chronic temperature stress in a common garden experiment. Here, we describe expression profiles obtained from the same corals for a panel of 9 previously reported and 10 novel candidate stress response genes identified in a pilot RNA-Seq experiment. The strongest expression change was observed in a novel candidate gene potentially involved in calcification, SLC26, a member of the solute carrier family 26 anion exchangers, which was down-regulated by 92-fold in bleached corals relative to controls. The most notable signature of divergence between coral populations was constitutive up-regulation of metabolic genes in corals from the warmer inshore location, including the gluconeogenesis enzymes pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and the lipid beta-oxidation enzyme acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Our observations highlight several molecular pathways that were not previously implicated in the coral stress response and suggest that host management of energy budgets might play an adaptive role in holobiont thermotolerance.},

abstract = {Understanding patterns of connectivity among populations of marine organisms is essential for the development of realistic, spatially explicit models of population dynamics. Two approaches, empirical genetic patterns and oceanographic dispersal modelling, have been used to estimate levels of evolutionary connectivity among marine populations but rarely have their potentially complementary insights been combined. Here, a spatially realistic Lagrangian model of larval dispersal and a theoretical genetic model are integrated with the most extensive study of gene flow in a Caribbean marine organism. The 871 genets collected from 26 sites spread over the wider Caribbean subsampled 45.8% of the 1900 potential unique genets in the model. At a coarse scale, significant consensus between modelled estimates of genetic structure and empirical genetic data for populations of the reef-building coral Montastraea annularis is observed. However, modelled and empirical data differ in their estimates of connectivity among northern Mesoamerican reefs indicating that processes other than dispersal may dominate here. Further, the geographic location and porosity of the previously described east-west barrier to gene flow in the Caribbean is refined. A multi-prong approach, integrating genetic data and spatially realistic models of larval dispersal and genetic projection, provides complementary insights into the processes underpinning population connectivity in marine invertebrates on evolutionary timescales.},

abstract = {Cytosymbiotic algae within the host's plasma are exposed to completely different ionic conditions than microalgae living in the sea. The altered ionic gradients, in particular, could be the reason for higher in hospite carbon assimilation levels. To study the effect of varying extracellular ionic conditions on isolated zooxanthellae, their photosynthetic capacity in pure seawater was compared to that in a test medium in which the concentrations of the major inorganic ions, the pH and the osmolality were adjusted to the conditions measured in the host cytoplasm. In this test medium the ratio between oxygen evolution and carbon fixation was 1.2:1.0; in contrast, zooxanthellae in the hyperionic seawater medium showed a comparatively higher oxygen production (2.6:1.0). These results are attributed to a higher energy demand for ion regulation of the isolated algae in the hyperionic medium. Isolated cytosymbionts in seawater need more energy both for the readjustment to the original intracellular ion concentration within the host cell and also for the maintenance of a much steeper gradient during incubation under hyperionic conditions outside the host. The particular intracellular ion concentration of the host cells could have been a decisive evolutionary factor for the very successful establishment of the mutualistic symbioses between anthozoans and dinoflagellates more than 200 million years ago.},

Species tested were Favia favus Forskal, Favites pentagona Esper, Platygyra daedalea Ellis {\&} Solander, Gyrosmilia interrupta Ehrenberg, Lobophytum depressum Tixier-Durivault, Lobophytum venustum Tixier-Durivault, Sinularia dum (Pratt), Sinularia leptoclados (Ehrenberg) and Sarcophyton glaucum (Quoy {\&} Gaimard). Natural sedimentation levels and light conditions were simulated. Photosynthetic carbon production and respiration were measured by respirometry. Loss of fixed carbon through mucus production was measured directly by filtration. The results were used to model daily energy budgets for these species. One set of models allowed for 50 % PARs (photosynthetically active radiation at the surface), another set of models allowed for 25 % PARs. The models showed severely diminished productivity and decreased respiration under sedimented conditions. Production/respiration (P/R) ratios of all species were above 1 in the absence of sediment and dropped below unity when the corals were subjected to sedimentation. Although overall respiration dropped, its demand upon the also diminished amount of photosynthetically produced carbon rose dramatically. Without sediment, mucus output averaged 35 % of daily respiration; this rose to 65 % when sediment was applied. Sediment affects coral metabolism by decreasing photosynthetic production, increasing relative respiration and increasing carbon-loss through greater mucus output.},

Ideally, the methods used should be rapid, precise, and accurate. In this study, we systematically evaluated methods for sample preparation and storage and the counting of algal cells using the hemocytometer, a custom image-analysis program for automated counting of the fluorescent algal cells, the Coulter Counter, or the Millipore Guava flow-cytometer. We found that although other methods may have value in particular applications, for most purposes, the Guava flow cytometer provided by far the best combination of precision, accuracy, and efficient use of investigator time (due to the instrument's automated sample handling), while also allowing counts of algal numbers over a wide range and in small volumes of tissue homogenate. We also found that either of two assays of total homogenate protein provided a precise and seemingly accurate basis for normalization of algal counts to the total amount of holobiont tissue.},

abstract = {With high-dimensional data, variable-by-variable statistical testing is often used to select variables whose behavior differs across conditions. Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering-using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative-is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

abstract = {Mutualisms provide benefits to interacting species, but they also involve costs. If costs come to exceed benefits as population density or the frequency of encounters between species increases, the interaction will no longer be mutualistic. Thus curves that represent benefits and costs as functions of interaction frequency are important tools for predicting when a mutualism will tip over into antagonism. Currently, most of what we know about benefit and cost curves in pollination mutualisms comes from highly specialized pollinating seed-consumer mutualisms, such as the yucca moth-yucca interaction. There, benefits to female reproduction saturate as the number of visits to a flower increases (because the amount of pollen needed to fertilize all the flower's ovules is finite), but costs continue to increase (because pollinator offspring consume developing seeds), leading to a peak in seed production at an intermediate number of visits. But for most plant-pollinator mutualisms, costs to the plant are more subtle than consumption of seeds, and how such costs scale with interaction frequency remains largely unknown. Here, we present reasonable benefit and cost curves that are appropriate for typical pollinator-plant interactions, and we show how they can result in a wide diversity of relationships between net benefit (benefit minus cost) and interaction frequency. We then use maximum-likelihood methods to fit net-benefit curves to measures of female reproductive success for three typical pollination mutualisms from two continents, and for each system we chose the most parsimonious model using information-criterion statistics. We discuss the implications of the shape of the net-benefit curve for the ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator mutualisms, as well as the challenges that lie ahead for disentangling the underlying benefit and cost curves for typical pollination mutualisms.},

abstract = {Corals provide the foundation of important tropical reef ecosystems but are in global decline for multiple reasons, including climate change. Coral health depends on a fragile partnership with intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts. We argue here that progress in understanding coral biology requires intensive study of the cellular processes underlying this symbiosis. Such study will inform us on how the coral symbiosis will be affected by climate change, mechanisms driving coral bleaching and disease, and the coevolution of this symbiosis in the context of other host-microbe interactions. Drawing lessons from the broader history of molecular and cell biology and the study of other host-microbe interactions, we argue that a model-systems approach is essential for making effective progress in understanding coral cell biology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Understanding the mechanisms by which natural populations cope with environmental stress is paramount to predict their persistence in the face of escalating anthropogenic impacts. Reef-building corals are increasingly exposed to local and global stressors that alter nutritional status causing reduced fitness and mortality, however, these responses can vary considerably across species and populations.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We compare the expression of 22 coral host genes in individuals from an inshore and an offshore reef location using quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) over the course of 26 days following translocation into a shaded, filtered seawater environment. Declines in lipid content and PSII activity of the algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium ITS-1 type C2) over the course of the experiment indicated that heterotrophic uptake and photosynthesis were limited, creating nutritional deprivation conditions. Regulation of coral host genes involved in metabolism, CO2 transport and oxidative stress could be detected already after five days, whereas PSII activity took twice as long to respond. Opposing expression trajectories of Tgl, which releases fatty acids from the triacylglycerol storage, and Dgat1, which catalyses the formation of triglycerides, indicate that the decline in lipid content can be attributed, at least in part, by mobilisation of triacylglycerol stores. Corals from the inshore location had initially higher lipid content and showed consistently elevated expression levels of two genes involved in metabolism (aldehyde dehydrogenase) and calcification (carbonic anhydrase).

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Coral host gene expression adjusts rapidly upon change in nutritional conditions, and therefore can serve as an early signature of imminent coral stress. Consistent gene expression differences between populations indicate that corals acclimatize and/or adapt to local environments. Our results set the stage for analysis of these processes in natural coral populations, to better understand the responses of coral communities to global climate change and to develop more efficient management strategies.},

abstract = {The effects of flow on the physiological ecology of Montastrea annularis, an important frame-building species of Caribbean coral reefs, were investigated in situ with a recirculating flow respirometry system deployed from an underwater habitat. For this species, primary production and respiration rates increase with increasing water motion. The slope of a nondimensional Sherwood (Sh)-Reynolds(Re) number plot indicates that forced convection increases dark respiration in a manner consistent with oxygen transfer through a turbulent boundary layer (ShBAR) = 0.01 Re1.30). A similar analysis for maximal photosynthetic rate yields a lower but significant slope (ShBAR = 0.71 Re0.63). A simple conceptual model of diffusional depletion in the boundary layer over the coral fits the data and accounts for the distribution of zooxanthellae. Calculations of phototrophic capacity for this species indicate that water motion can enhance the local productivity of the reef.},

We examined an incidence of bleaching in a field population of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt). Our data suggest that expulsion of zooxanthellae was caused by reduced salinity from freshwater runoff after heavy rainfall. In the laboratory, A. elegantissima expelled zooxanthellae in quantities directly correlated with strength and duration of exposure to hyposalinity. The mechanism of release appears to be rupture of the host cell, followed by accumulation of clumps of zooxanthellae that are then expelled from the coelenteron. A. elegantissima has little or no ability to osmoregulate the water in its coelenteron, and internal salinity drops rapidly with external salinity reduction. },

abstract = {Coral communities in the Persian/Arabian Gulf (PAG) withstand unusually high salinity levels and regular summer temperature maxima of up to ∼35 {\textdegree}C that kill conspecifics elsewhere. Due to the recent formation of the PAG and its subsequent shift to a hot climate, these corals have had only <6,000 y to adapt to these extreme conditions and can therefore inform on how coral reefs may respond to global warming. One key to coral survival in the world's warmest reefs are symbioses with a newly discovered alga,Symbiodinium thermophilum Currently, it is unknown whether this symbiont originated elsewhere or emerged from unexpectedly fast evolution catalyzed by the extreme environment. Analyzing genetic diversity of symbiotic algae across >5,000 km of the PAG, the Gulf of Oman, and the Red Sea coastline, we show thatS. thermophilumis a member of a highly diverse, ancient group of symbionts cryptically distributed outside the PAG. We argue that the adjustment to temperature extremes by PAG corals was facilitated by the positive selection of preadapted symbionts. Our findings suggest that maintaining the largest possible pool of potentially stress-tolerant genotypes by protecting existing biodiversity is crucial to promote rapid adaptation to present-day climate change, not only for coral reefs, but for ecosystems in general.},

abstract = {Occurrences whereby cnidaria lose their symbiotic dinoflagellate microalgae (Symbiodinium spp.) are increasing in frequency and intensity. These so-called bleaching events are most often related to an increase in water temperature, which is thought to limit certain Symbiodinium phylotypes from effectively dissipating absorbed excitation energy that is otherwise used for photochemistry. Here, we examined photosynthetic characteristics and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, a possible signal involved in bleaching, from two Symbiodinium types (a thermally "tolerant" A1 and "sensitive" B1) representative of cnidaria-Symbiodinium symbioses of reef-building Caribbean corals. Under steady-state growth at 26 degrees C, a higher efficiency of PSII photochemistry, rate of electron turnover, and rate of O-2 production were observed for type A1 than for B1. The two types responded very differently to a period of elevated temperature (32 degrees C): type A1 increased light-driven O-2 consumption but not the amount of H2O2 produced; in contrast, type B1 increased the amount of H2O2 produced without an increase in light-driven O-2 consumption. Therefore, our results are consistent with previous suggestions that the thermal tolerance of Symbiodinium is related to adaptive constraints associated with photosynthesis and that sensitive phylotypes are more prone to H2O2 production. Understanding these adaptive differences in the genus Symbiodinium will be crucial if we are to interpret the response of symbiotic associations, including reef-building corals, to environmental change.},

Larvae of Artemia served as infecting vectors. Chimeric infections were obtained with two different Chlorella strains cohabiting in the same cells and polyps. In time, the chimeric infections disappeared and mixed populations of Hydra were formed with different strains of Chlorella in different polyps. We suggest that the Chlorella/Hydra symbiosis was initiated originally by an infection of preadapted hydra by preadapted chlorellae. Through intracellular interalgal competition and competition between dissimilar infected cells and polyps, the present-day stable symbiosis has evolved.},

abstract = {Researchers commonly compute percentages or size-specific indices in an attempt to remove effects of body size from physiological data. Unfortunately, such ratios seldom eliminate the influence of body size on a physiological response and the ratios introduce major (but often unrecognized) problems with respect to statistical analysis and interpretation of the data. Indeed, these shortcomings of ratios frequently lead investigators to arrive at incorrect conclusions in otherwise flawless experiments. A superior alternative to using ratios combines graphical analysis and the analysis of covariance, which is a widely available statistical routine that uses least-squares regression to remove effects of body size from physiological data. Accordingly, we counsel researchers to discontinue forming ratios in an attempt to normalize physiological data for variation in body size and to adopt a reliable alternative. We also advise readers of scientific research not to place great confidence in results of studies that use ratios for scaling. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Coral bleaching, the loss of color due to loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae or their pigment, appears to be increasing in intensity and geographic extent, perhaps related to increasing sea surface temperatures. The adaptive bleaching hypothesis (ABH) posits that when environmental circumstances change, the loss of one or more kinds of zooxanthellae is rapidly, sometimes unnoticeably, followed by formation of a new symbiotic consortium with different zooxanthellae that are more suited to the new conditions in the host's habitat. Fundamental assumptions of the ABH include (1) different types of zooxanthellae respond differently to environmental conditions, specifically temperature. and (2) bleached adults can secondarily acquire zooxanthellae from the environment. We present simple tests of these assumptions and show that (1) genetically different strains of zooxanthellae exhibit different responses to elevated temperature, (2) bleached adult hosts can acquire algal symbionts with an apparently dose-dependent relationship between the concentration of zooxanthellae and the rate of establishment of the symbiosis, (3) and finally, bleached adult hosts can acquire symbionts from the water column.},

abstract = {The declining health of coral reefs worldwide is likely to intensify in response to continued anthropogenic disturbance from coastal development, pollution, and climate change. In response to these stresses, reef-building corals may exhibit bleaching, which marks the breakdown in symbiosis between coral and zooxanthellae. Mass coral bleaching due to elevated water temperature can devastate coral reefs on a large geographical scale. In order to understand the molecular and cellular basis of bleaching in corals, we have measured gene expression changes associated with thermal stress and bleaching using a complementary DNA microarray containing 1310 genes of the Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata. In a first experiment, we identified differentially expressed genes by comparing experimentally bleached M. faveolata fragments to control non-heat-stressed fragments. In a second experiment, we identified differentially expressed genes during a time course experiment with four time points across 9 days. Results suggest that thermal stress and bleaching in M. faveolata affect the following processes: oxidative stress, Ca2+ homeostasis, cytoskeletal organization, cell death, calcification, metabolism, protein synthesis, heat shock protein activity, and transposon activity. These results represent the first medium-scale transcriptomic study focused on revealing the cellular foundation of thermal stress-induced coral bleaching. We postulate that oxidative stress in thermal-stressed corals causes a disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, which in turn leads to cytoskeletal and cell adhesion changes, decreased calcification, and the initiation of cell death via apoptosis and necrosis.},

abstract = {Coral reef degradation resulting from nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is of increasing global concern. Although effects of nutrients on coral reef organisms have been demonstrated in the laboratory, there is little direct evidence of nutrient effects on coral reef biota in situ. The ENCORE experiment investigated responses of coral reef organisms and processes to controlled additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) on an offshore reef(One Tree Island) at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. A multi-disciplinary team assessed a variety of factors focusing on nutrient dynamics and biotic responses. A controlled and replicated experiment was conducted over two years using twelve small patch reefs ponded at low tide by a coral rim. Treatments included three control reefs (no nutrient addition) and three + N reefs (NH4Cl added), three + P reefs (KH2PO4 added), and three + N + P reefs. Nutrients were added as pulses at each low tide (ca twice per day) by remotely operated units. There were two phases of nutrient additions. During the initial, low-loading phase of the experiment nutrient pulses (mean dose = 11.5 muM NH4+; 2.3 muM PO4-3) rapidly declined, reaching near-background levels (mean = 0.9 muM NH4+; 0.5 muM PO4-3) within 2-3 h. A variety of biotic processes, assessed over a year during this initial nutrient loading phase, were not significantly affected, with the exception of coral reproduction, which was affected in all nutrient treatments. In Acropora longicyathus and A. aspera, fewer successfully developed embryos were formed, and in A. longicyathus fertilization rates and lipid levels decreased. In the second, high-loading, phase of ENCORE an increased nutrient dosage (mean dose = 36.2 muM NH4+; 5.1 muM PO4-3 declining to means of 11.3 muM NH4+ and 2.4 muM PO4-3 at the end of low tide) was used for a further year, and a variety of significant biotic responses occurred. Encrusting algae incorporated virtually none of the added nutrients. Organisms containing endosymbiotic zooxanthellae (corals and giant clams) assimilated dissolved nutrients rapidly and were responsive to added nutrients. Coral mortality, not detected during the initial low-loading phase, became evident with increased nutrient dosage, particularly in Pocillopora damicornis. Nitrogen additions stunted coral growth, and phosphorus additions had a variable effect. Coral calcification rate and linear extension increased in the presence of added phosphorus but skeletal density was reduced, making corals more susceptible to breakage. Settlement of all coral larvae was reduced in nitrogen treatments, yet settlement of larvae from brooded species was enhanced in phosphorus treatments. Recruitment of stomatopods, benthic crustaceans living in coral rubble, was reduced in nitrogen and nitrogen plus phosphorus treatments. Grazing rates and reproductive effort of various fish species were not affected by the nutrient treatments. Microbial nitrogen transformations in sediments,were responsive to nutrient loading with nitrogen fixation significantly increased in phosphorus treatments and denitrification increased in all treatments to which nitrogen had been added. Rates of bioerosion and grazing showed no significant effects of added nutrients,ENCORE has shown that reef organisms and processes investigated ill situ were impacted by elevated nutrients. Impacts mere dependent on dose level, whether nitrogen and/or phosphorus mere elevated and were often species-specific. The impacts were generally sub-lethal and subtle and the treated reefs at the end of the experiment mere visually similar to control reefs. Rapid nutrient uptake indicates that nutrient concentrations alone are not adequate to assess nutrient condition of reefs. Sensitive and quantifiable biological indicators need to be developed for coral reef ecosystems. The potential bioindicators identified in ENCORE should be tested in future research on coral reef/nutrient interactions. Synergistic and cumulative effects of elevated nutrients and other environmental parameters, comparative studies of intact vs. disturbed reefs, offshore vs, inshore reefs, or the ability of a nutrient-stressed reef to respond to natural disturbances require elucidation. An expanded understanding of coral reef responses to anthropogenic impacts is necessary, particularly regarding the subtle, sub-lethal effects detected in the ENCORE studies.

abstract = {Coral reefs, with their millions of species, have changed profoundly because of the effects of people, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Reefs are subject to many of the same processes that affect other human-dominated ecosystems, but some special features merit emphasis: (i) Many dominant reef builders spawn eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. They are thus particularly vulnerable to Allee effects, including potential extinction associated with chronic reproductive failure. (ii) The corals likely to be most resistant to the effects of habitat degradation are small, short-lived "weedy" corals that have limited dispersal capabilities at the larval stage. Habitat degradation, together with habitat fragmentation, will therefore lead to the establishment of genetically isolated clusters of inbreeding corals. (iii) Increases in average sea temperatures by as little as 1 degreesC, a likely result of global climate change, can cause coral "bleaching" (the breakdown of coral-algal symbiosis), changes in symbiont communities, and coral death. (iv) The activities of people near reefs increase both fishing pressure and nutrient inputs. In general, these processes favor more rapidly growing competitors, often fleshy seaweeds, and may also result in explosions of predator populations. (v) Combinations of stress appear to be associated with threshold responses and Ecological surprises, including devastating pathogen outbreaks. (vi) The fossil record suggests that corals as a group are more likely to suffer extinctions than some of the groups that associate with them, whose habitat requirements may be less stringent.},

abstract = {The genetic enhancement of wild animals and plants for characteristics that benefit human populations has been practiced for thousands of years, resulting in impressive improvements in commercially valuable species. Despite these benefits, genetic manipulations are rarely considered for noncommercial purposes, such as conservation and restoration initiatives. Over the last century, humans have driven global climate change through industrialization and the release of increasing amounts of CO2, resulting in shifts in ocean temperature, ocean chemistry, and sea level, as well as increasing frequency of storms, all of which can profoundly impact marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that have suffered massive declines in health and abundance as a result of these and other direct anthropogenic disturbances. There is great concern that the high rates, magnitudes, and complexity of environmental change are overwhelming the intrinsic capacity of corals to adapt and survive. Although it is important to address the root causes of changing climate, it is also prudent to explore the potential to augment the capacity of reef organisms to tolerate stress and to facilitate recovery after disturbances. Here, we review the risks and benefits of the improvement of natural and commercial stocks in noncoral reef systems and advocate a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of developing coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through the acceleration of naturally occurring processes, an approach known as (human)-assisted evolution, while at the same time initiating a public dialogue on the risks and benefits of this approach.},

Here, we describe an approach for transforming the exponential, analog nature of the PCR into a linear, digital signal suitable for this purpose. Single molecules are isolated by dilution and individually amplified by PCR; each product is then analyzed separately for the presence of mutations by using fluorescent probes. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through the detection of a mutant ras oncogene in the stool of patients with colorectal cancer. The process provides a reliable and quantitative measure of the proportion of variant sequences within a DNA sample.},

abstract = {The challenges corals and symbiotic cnidarians face from global environmental change brings new urgency to understanding fundamental elements of their physiology. Intracellular pH (pHi) influences almost all aspects of cellular physiology but has never been described in anthozoans or symbiotic cnidarians, despite its pivotal role in carbon concentration for photosynthesis and calcification. Using confocal microscopy and the pH sensitive probe carboxy SNARF-1, we mapped pHi in short-term light and dark-incubated cells of the reef coral Stylophora pistillata and the symbiotic anemone Anemonia viridis. In all cells isolated from both species, pHi was markedly lower than the surrounding seawater pH of 8.1. In cells that contained symbiotic algae, mean values of pHi were significantly higher in light treated cells than dark treated cells (7.41 +/- 0.22 versus 7.13 +/- 0.24 for S. pistillata; and 7.29 +/- 0.15 versus 7.01 +/- 0.27 for A. viridis). In contrast, there was no significant difference in pHi in light and dark treated cells without algal symbionts. Close inspection of the interface between host cytoplasm and algal symbionts revealed a distinct area of lower pH adjacent to the symbionts in both light and dark treated cells, possibly associated with the symbiosome membrane complex. These findings are significant developments for the elucidation of models of inorganic carbon transport for photosynthesis and calcification and also provide a cell imaging procedure for future investigations into how pHi and other fundamental intracellular parameters in corals respond to changes in the external environment such as reductions in seawater pH.},

abstract = {As most biologists are probably aware, technological advances in molecular biology during the last few years have opened up possibilities to rapidly generate large-scale sequencing data from non-model organisms at a reasonable cost. In an era when virtually any study organism can 'go genomic', it is worthwhile to review how this may impact molecular ecology. The first studies to put the next generation sequencing (NGS) to the test in ecologically well-characterized species without previous genome information were published in 2007 and the beginning of 2008. Since then several studies have followed in their footsteps, and a large number are undoubtedly under way. This review focuses on how NGS has been, and can be, applied to ecological, population genetic and conservation genetic studies of non-model species, in which there is no (or very limited) genomic resources. Our aim is to draw attention to the various possibilities that are opening up using the new technologies, but we also highlight some of the pitfalls and drawbacks with these methods. We will try to provide a snapshot of the current state of the art for this rapidly advancing and expanding field of research and give some likely directions for future developments.},

abstract = {Effects of nutrient treatments on photoacclimation of the hermatypic coral Stylophora pistillata (Esper) were studied. Studies on photoacclimation of colonies from different light regimes in the field were evaluated and used to design laboratory experiments. Coral colonies were collected in the Gulf of Eilat (Israel) from January to March 1993. Exterior branches of colonies from different depths (1 to 40 m) displayed different trends in production characteristics at reduced and very low levels of illumination. From 24 +/- 3% to 12 +/- 2% of incident surface photosynthetic active radiation (PAR(o)), zooxanthella population density and chlorophyll cl-fu per 10(6) zooxanthellae increased, a trend seen in the range of light levels optimal for coral growth (90 to 30% PAR(o)). The P-max of CO2 per 10(6) zooxanthellae decreased, while P-max of CO2 per 10(3) polyps increased, indicating an increase in zooxanthella population density at low light levels. Proliferous zooxanthella frequency (PZF, a measure of zooxanthella division) declined significantly at light levels < 18 +/- 3% PAR(o). At the lowest levels of illumination (< 5% PAR(o)), zooxanthella population density decreased, as did the PZF; chi a + c per 10(6) zooxanthellae was unchanged. In 28-d experiments, exterior coral branches from the upper surfaces of colonies from 3 m depth (65 +/- 4% PAR(o)) were incubated in aquaria under bright (80 to 90% PAR(o)), reduced (20 to 30% PAR(o)), and extremely low (2 to 4% PAR(o)) light intensities. At each light intensity, the corals were maintained in three feeding treatments: sea water (SW); ammonium enriched SW (SW + N); SW with Artemia salina nauplii (SW + A). An increase in P-max of CO2 per 10(3) polyps was found in corals acclimated to reduced light (20 to 30% PAR,) in nutrient-enriched SW, while in SW, where the increase in zooxanthella population density was smaller, it did not occur. Nutrient enrichments (SW + N at 2 to 4% PAR(o) and SW + A at 20 to 30% PAR(o)) increased zooxanthella population density, but had no effect on chi a + c per 10(6) zooxanthellae. Acclimation for 14 d to reduced (10 to 20% PAR(o)) and extremely low (1 to 3% PAR(o)) light intensities shifted C-14 photoassimilation into glycerol and other compounds (probably glycerides), rather than sugars. Both ammonium addition and feeding with Artemia salina nauplii resulted in an increase in photosynthetic assimilation of C-14 into amino acids. We conclude that acclimation to reduced light consists of two processes: an increase in photosynthetic pigments and in zooxanthella population density. Both processes require nitrogen, the increase in zooxanthella population density needing more; this adaptation is therefore limited in nitrogen-poor sea water.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are generally considered to be the most biologically productive of all marine ecosystems, but in recent times these vulnerable aquatic resources have been subject to unusual degradation. The general decline in reefs has been greatly accelerated by mass bleaching in which corals whiten en masse and often fail to recover. Empirical evidence indicates a coral reef bleaching cycle in which major bleaching episodes are synchronized with El Nino events that occur every 3-4 years on average. By heating vast areas of the Pacific Ocean, and affecting the Indian and Atlantic Oceans as well, El Nino causes widespread damage to reefs largely because corals are very sensitive to temperature changes. However, mass bleaching events were rarely observed before the 1970s and their abrupt appearance two decades ago remains an enigma. Here we propose a new explanation for the sudden occurrence of mass bleaching and show that it may be a response to the relative increase in El Nino experienced over the last two decades.},

abstract = {Few time series of deep-sea systems exist from which the factors affecting abyssal fish populations can be evaluated. Previous analysis showed an increase in grenadier abundance, in the eastern North Pacific, which lagged epibenthic megafaunal abundance, mostly echinoderms, by 9{\textendash}20 months. Subsequent diet studies suggested that carrion is the grenadier's most important food. Our goal was to evaluate if changes in carrion supply might drive the temporal changes in grenadier abundance. We analyzed a unique 17 year time series of abyssal grenadier abundance and size, collected at Station M (4100 m, 220 km offshore of Pt. Conception, California), and reaffirmed the increase in abundance and also showed an increase in mean size resulting in a ∼6 fold change in grenadier biomass. We compared this data with abundance estimates for surface living nekton (pacific hake and jack mackerel) eaten by the grenadiers as carrion. A significant positive correlation between Pacific hake (but not jack mackerel) and grenadiers was found. Hake seasonally migrate to the waters offshore of California to spawn. They are the most abundant nekton species in the region and the target of the largest commercial fishery off the west coast. The correlation to grenadier abundance was strongest when using hake abundance metrics from the area within 100 nmi of Station M. No significant correlation between grenadier abundance and hake biomass for the entire California current region was found. Given the results and grenadier longevity, migration is likely responsible for the results and the location of hake spawning probably is more important than the size of the spawning stock in understanding the dynamics of abyssal grenadier populations. Our results suggest that some abyssal fishes' population dynamics are controlled by the flux of large particles of carrion. Climate and fishing pressures affecting epipelagic fish stocks could readily modulate deep-sea fish dynamics.},

The UVR exposure by the transplanted colonies was significantly higher than that at 20 m, while photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) only increased by 9%. Photosynthetic pigments, quantified with HPLC, as well as linear extension rates and skeletal densities, were significantly reduced I month after transplantation to I m depth, while MAAs increased significantly despite immediate paling experienced by transplanted colonies. While these colonies showed a significant reduction in photosynthetic pigments, there v ere no significant reductions in zooxanthellae densities suggesting photoacclimation of the coral's symbionts to the new radiation conditions. The results suggest that while corals might be able to survive sudden increases in UVR and PAR, their skeletal structure can be greatly debilitated due to a reduction in the photosynthetic capacity of their symbionts and a possible relocation of resources.},

abstract = {The global decline of reef-building corals is due in part to the loss of algal symbionts, or "bleaching," during the increasingly frequent periods of high seawater temperatures. During bleaching, endosymbiotic dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium spp.) either are lost from the animal tissue or lose their photosynthetic pigments, resulting in host mortality if the Symbiodinium populations fail to recover. The >1,000 studies of the causes of heat-induced bleaching have focused overwhelmingly on the consequences of damage to algal photosynthetic processes, and the prevailing model for bleaching invokes a light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by heat-damaged chloroplasts as the primary trigger. However, the precise mechanisms of bleaching remain unknown, and there is evidence for involvement of multiple cellular processes. In this study, we asked the simple question of whether bleaching can be triggered by heat in the dark, in the absence of photosynthetically derived ROS. We used both the sea anemone model system Aiptasia and several species of reef-building corals to demonstrate that symbiont loss can occur rapidly during heat stress in complete darkness. Furthermore, we observed damage to the photosynthetic apparatus under these conditions in both Aiptasia endosymbionts and cultured Symbiodinium. These results do not directly contradict the view that light-stimulated ROS production is important in bleaching, but they do show that there must be another pathway leading to bleaching. Elucidation of this pathway should help to clarify bleaching mechanisms under the more usual conditions of heat stress in the light.},

However, little is known about the evolution of organellar DNA in these organisms. We analysed domain V of the chloroplast large subunit ribosomal DNA (cp23S-rDNA) from a variety of symbiotic dinoflagellates and uncovered several unique features. These included length heteroplasmy of cp23S-rDNA that resulted from deletion mutations and the presence of a 1-13 bp nucleotide insertion in the universal core region. The insertion in the large subunit rDNA is novel across all kingdoms and appears to be a unique derived state for the symbiotic genus Symbiodinium. In addition, analysis of expansion segments (ES) revealed that the cp23S-rDNA domain V of symbiotic dinoflagellates is the most size variable of any known plastid-harbouring organism. Our results demonstrate that the universal core secondary structure and the chloroplast rDNA ES are less constrained in size than previously thought.},

abstract = {This study examines molecular relationships across a wide range of species in the mass spawning scleractinian coral genus Acropora. Molecular phylogenies were obtained for 28 species using DNA sequence analyses of two independent markers, a nuclear intron and the mtDNA putative control region. Although the compositions of the major clades in the phylogenies based on these two markers were similar, there were several important differences. This, in combination with the fact that many species were not monophyletic, suggests either that introgressive hybridization is occurring or that lineage sorting is incomplete. The molecular tree topologies bear little similarity to the results of a recent cladistic analysis based on skeletal morphology and are at odds with the fossil record. We hypothesize that these conflicting results may be due to the same morphology having evolved independently more than once in Acropora and/or the occurrence of extensive interspecific hybridization and introgression in combination with morphology being determined by a small number of genes. Our results indicate that many Acropora species belong to a species complex or syngameon and that morphology has little predictive value with regard to syngameon composition. Morphological species in the genus often do not correspond to genetically distinct evolutionary units. Instead, species that differ in timing of gamete release tend to constitute genetically distinct clades.},

abstract = {In parts of its range, the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt) is populated by two different symbiotic algae: zoochlorellae and zooxanthellae. Anemones with exclusively one or the other symbiont were compared under identical conditions. A zooxanthella was about twice the volume and carbon content of a zoochlorella, and contained more chlorophyll. Zooxanthellae population density was 24% less than zoochlorellae, consequently zooxanthellae protein biomass per unit animal was only 58% greater than zoochlorellae. The mitotic index (MI) of zoochlorellae was almost 22 times greater than zooxanthellae, and the diel cell division pattern was asynchronous in both algae. Using duration of cytokinesis times (t(d)) of 28 and 69 h for zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae, respectively, we estimated that zoochlorellae grew eight times faster than zooxanthellae, with a commensurately shorter population doubling time. Zooxanthella respiration was two and a half times and net photosynthesis twice that of a zoochlorella; this coupled with a comparatively low growth rate allows the zooxanthellae population to potentially translocate almost five times as much carbon to its host as do zoochlorellae. The contribution of carbon to animal respiration (CZAR) was estimated at 48% for the zooxanthellate and only 9% for zoochlorellate anemones. It is suggested that these associations may be similar to ancestral symbioses.},

Why do symbionts provide costly services to a host, indirectly benefiting competitors sharing the same individual host? Host monitoring of symbiont performance and the imposition of sanctions on 'cheats' could stabilize mutualism. Here we show that soybeans penalize rhizobia that fail to fix N(2) inside their root nodules. We prevented a normally mutualistic rhizobium strain from cooperating (fixing N(2)) by replacing air with an N(2)-free atmosphere (Ar:O(2)). A series of experiments at three spatial scales (whole plants, half root systems and individual nodules) demonstrated that forcing non-cooperation (analogous to cheating) decreased the reproductive success of rhizobia by about 50%. Non-invasive monitoring implicated decreased O(2) supply as a possible mechanism for sanctions against cheating rhizobia. More generally, such sanctions by one or both partners may be important in stabilizing a wide range of mutualistic symbioses.},

abstract = {Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the persistence of coral reefs. Sustained and ongoing increases in ocean temperatures and acidification are altering the structure and function of reefs globally. Here, we summarise recent advances in our understanding of the effects of climate change on scleractinian corals and reef fish. Although there is considerable among-species variability in responses to increasing temperature and seawater chemistry, changing temperature regimes are likely to have the greatest influence on the structure of coral and fish assemblages, at least over short{\textendash}medium timeframes. Recent evidence of increases in coral bleaching thresholds, local genetic adaptation and inheritance of heat tolerance suggest that coral populations may have some capacity to respond to warming, although the extent to which these changes can keep pace with changing environmental conditions is unknown. For coral reef fishes, current evidence indicates increasing seawater temperature will be a major determinant of future assemblages, through both habitat degradation and direct effects on physiology and behaviour. The effects of climate change are, however, being compounded by a range of anthropogenic disturbances, which may undermine the capacity of coral reef organisms to acclimate and/or adapt to specific changes in environmental conditions.},

(1967) showed that Chlorohydra hadleyi took up a variety of algae, including algae from Hydra viridis; but only the host's own native symbionts were infective and ex-hibited the morphological distinction of one alga per vacuole. The other algae were slow to infect, appeared collectively in common vacuoles, and did not persist as symbionts. Pardy {\&}amp; Muscatine (1973) and Pool (1975) demonstrated that of a range of symbiotic algae from Spongilla, Paramecium, and various strains of H. viridis, only one strain from P. bursaria and algae from Hydra viridis (English strain) were infective in H. viridis (Florida strain). It may be con-cluded that since only these symbiotic algae were infective in symbiotic hydra, and since nonsymbiotic hydra ultimately reject all algae including these sym-bionts, that recognition is highly specific and a function of both the hydra and the algae.


Heterlogous host/symbiont combinations can be formed, although are established at slower rates. Once established, heterologous symbionts can be isolated and can infect other heterologous hosts with equal efficiency as homologous symbionts. Meanwhile, heterologous symbionts cultured in artificial medium are not very infective. Thus, host modifies symbiont properties in some way. COOL!

abstract = {P>Rising sea temperatures cause mass coral bleaching and threaten reefs worldwide. We show how maps of variations in thermal stress can be used to help manage reefs for climate change. We map proxies of chronic and acute thermal stress and develop evidence-based hypotheses for the future response of corals to each stress regime. We then incorporate spatially realistic predictions of larval connectivity among reefs of the Bahamas and apply novel reserve design algorithms to create reserve networks for a changing climate. We show that scales of larval dispersal are large enough to connect reefs from desirable thermal stress regimes into a reserve network. Critically, we find that reserve designs differ according to the anticipated scope for phenotypic and genetic adaptation in corals, which remains uncertain. Attempts to provide a complete reserve design that hedged against different evolutionary outcomes achieved limited success, which emphasises the importance of considering the scope for adaptation explicitly. Nonetheless, 15% of reserve locations were selected under all evolutionary scenarios, making them a high priority for early designation. Our approach allows new insights into coral holobiont adaptation to be integrated directly into an adaptive approach to management.},

abstract = {Author Summary In DNA, information is encoded as a sequence of four types of building blocks{\textendash}nucleotides. The most common technique for determining such sequences, the Sanger method, outputs a single consensus for a pool of DNA molecules in the analyzed sample. When these are identical, each site in the output contains a single nucleotide call. Yet, samples from organisms with two sets of chromosomes generally contain two types of DNA molecules (alleles), each derived from one parent. If, due to insertion or deletion (indel) mutations, one allele contains extra nucleotides, most sites in the sequencing output beyond the mutation site will contain pairs of nucleotide calls. While signaling the presence of a potentially important mutation, such output cannot be read directly and often gets discarded. Here we describe an algorithmic method which accurately reconstructs the pair of allelic sequences from the observed complex pattern of calls. Unlike most existing computational approaches to the problem, our method does not require knowledge of one of the involved sequences to use as a reference, nor any other additional information. Therefore, it can facilitate sequencing of indel-rich regions of genomes and speed up discovery and characterization of indel mutations, including those causing diseases in humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Coral bleaching (i.e., the release of coral symbiotic zooxanthellae) has negative impacts on biodiversity and functioning of reef ecosystems and their production of goods and services. This increasing world-wide phenomenon is associated with temperature anomalies, high irradiance, pollution, and bacterial diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that personal care products, including sunscreens, have an impact on aquatic organisms similar to that of other contaminants.

OBJECTIVES:Our goal was to evaluate the potential impact of sunscreen ingredients on hard corals and their symbiotic algae.

METHODS:In situ and laboratory experiments were conducted in several tropical regions (the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, and the Red Sea) by supplementing coral branches with aliquots of sunscreens and common ultraviolet filters contained in sunscreen formula. Zooxanthellae were checked for viral infection by epifluorescence and transmission electron microscopy analyses.

RESULTS:Sunscreens cause the rapid and complete bleaching of hard corals, even at extremely low concentrations. The effect of sunscreens is due to organic ultraviolet filters, which are able to induce the lytic viral cycle in symbiotic zooxanthellae with latent infections.

CONCLUSIONS:We conclude that sunscreens, by promoting viral infection, potentially play an important role in coral bleaching in areas prone to high levels of recreational use by humans.},

Yet this fragile association is highly vulnerable to environmental disturbance. A coral{\textquoteright}s ability to tolerate temperature stress depends on the fitness of its resident symbionts, whose thermal optima vary extensively between lineages. However, the in hospite population genetic structure of Symbiodinium is poorly understood and mostly based on analysis of bulk DNA extracted from thousands to millions of cells. Using quantitative single-cell PCR, we enumerated DNA polymorphisms in the symbionts of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis, and applied a model selection approach to explore the potential for recombination between coexisting Symbiodinium populations.},

We grew multiple genotypes of two grasses species (Lolium perenne and Lolium arundinaceum) infected (or uninfected) with Neotyphodium sp. under limited light or water availability and measured both biomass and relative growth rates. There was a significant interaction between water stress and infection in L. perenne, while in L. arundinaceum, there were significant differences between infected and uninfected plants but no significant interaction. In both species, there were significant interactions between light level and infection. At full sun, infected plants were larger, while under reduced light, uninfected plants produced as much biomass as or more than infected plants. Although infected plants have increased vigor under high resource levels, infection will not necessarily result in increased host growth when resources are limiting. The costs and benefits of symbiotic associations should be assessed in a variety of environments to better understand the potential range of interactions.},

abstract = {Experiments were performed in controlled conditions in order to investigate the effect of light and/or feeding on the delta N-15 composition of zooxanthellae and animal tissue of a scleractinian coral, Stylophora pistillata. For this purpose, corals were cultured under 3 light levels (80, 200, and 300 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and for each light level, half of the corals were fed twice a week with natural zooplankton while the other half, the control group, were starved. To understand how plankton ingestion changes the isotopic signal of the corals, zooplankton delta N-15 was also measured during the course of the experiment. It had a mean value of 6.75 parts per thousand. No significant and consistent effect of light was observed on the delta N-15 of the tissue or zooxanthellae of S. pistillata. However, there was a significant depletion in tissue and zooxanthellae N-15 of fed corals compared to the controls. This depletion did not follow the general food-web rule in which predators are enriched in N-15 by 3.5 parts per thousand compared to prey, but can be explained by the fact that nitrogen is recycled within the symbiotic association. Indeed, in heterotrophic organisms, the enrichment is due to light nitrogen (N-14) being preferentially excreted in the form of waste products into the environment, which leads to an increase in the delta N-15 signature of the animal. In corals, light waste products are instead recycled by the zooxanthellae, therefore depleting the isotopic signature of the zooxanthellae, and also of the host, by transfer of photosynthates with light nitrogen. These observations support the nitrogen-recycling rather than the nitrogen-conservation theory.},

abstract = {Elevated seawater temperatures are associated with coral bleaching events and related mortality. Nevertheless, some coral species are able to survive bleaching and recover. The apoptotic responses associated to this ability were studied over 3 years in the coral Stylophora pistillata from the Gulf of Eilat subjected to long term thermal stress. These include caspase activity and the expression profiles of the S. pistillata caspase and Bcl-2 genes (StyCasp and StyBcl-2-like) cloned in this study. In corals exposed to thermal stress (32 or 34{\textdegree}C), caspase activity and the expression levels of the StyBcl-2-like gene increased over time (6-48 h) and declined to basal levels within 72 h of thermal stress. Distinct transcript levels were obtained for the StyCasp gene, with stimulated expression from 6 to 48 h of 34{\textdegree}C thermal stress, coinciding with the onset of bleaching. Increased cell death was detected in situ only between 6 to 48 h of stress and was limited to the gastroderm. The bleached corals survived up to one month at 32{\textdegree}C, and recovered back symbionts when placed at 24{\textdegree}C. These results point to a two-stage response in corals that withstand thermal stress: (i) the onset of apoptosis, accompanied by rapid activation of anti-oxidant/anti-apoptotic mediators that block the progression of apoptosis to other cells and (ii) acclimatization of the coral to the chronic thermal stress alongside the completion of symbiosis breakdown. Accordingly, the coral's ability to rapidly curb apoptosis appears to be the most important trait affecting the coral's thermotolerance and survival.},

abstract = {Population connectivity through larval dispersal is an essential parameter in models of marine population dynamics and the optimal size and spacing of marine reserves. However, there are remarkably few direct estimates of larval dispersal for marine organisms, and the actual birth sites of successful recruits have never been located. Here, we solve the mystery of the natal origin of clownfish (Amphiprion polymnus) juveniles by mass-marking via tetracycline immersion all larvae produced in a population. In addition, we established parentage by DNA genotyping all potential adults and all new recruits arriving in the population. Although no individuals settled into the same anemone as their parents, many settled remarkably close to home. Even though this species has a 9-12 day larval duration, one-third of settled juveniles had returned to a 2 hectare natal area, with many settling <100 m from their birth site. This represents the smallest scale of dispersal known for any marine fish species with a pelagic larval phase. The degree of local retention indicates that marine reserves can provide recruitment benefits not only beyond but also within their boundaries.},

abstract = {Coral reefs and the services they provide are seriously threatened by ocean acidification and climate change impacts like coral bleaching. Here, we present updated global projections for these key threats to coral reefs based on ensembles of IPCC AR5 climate models using the new Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) experiments. For all tropical reef locations, we project absolute and percentage changes in aragonite saturation state ($\Omega$arag) for the period between 2006 and the onset of annual severe bleaching (thermal stress >8 degree heating weeks); a point at which it is difficult to believe reefs can persist as we know them. Severe annual bleaching is projected to start 10-15~years later at high-latitude reefs than for reefs in low latitudes under RCP8.5. In these 10-15~years, $\Omega$arag keeps declining and thus any benefits for high-latitude reefs of later onset of annual bleaching may be negated by the effects of acidification. There are no long-term refugia from the effects of both acidification and bleaching. Of all reef locations, 90% are projected to experience severe bleaching annually by 2055. Furthermore, 5% declines in calcification are projected for all reef locations by 2034 under RCP8.5, assuming a 15% decline in calcification per unit of $\Omega$arag. Drastic emissions cuts, such as those represented by RCP6.0, result in an average year for the onset of annual severe bleaching that is {\textasciitilde}20~years later (2062 vs. 2044). However, global emissions are tracking above the current worst-case scenario devised by the scientific community, as has happened in previous generations of emission scenarios. The projections here for conditions on coral reefs are dire, but provide the most up-to-date assessment of what the changing climate and ocean acidification mean for the persistence of coral reefs.},

Despite their ubiquity, we are only beginning to resolve major patterns of symbiont ecology and evolution. Here, we summarize the history, current progress, and projected future of the study of microbial symbiont evolution throughout the tree of life. We focus on the recent surge of data that whole- genome sequencing has introduced into the field, in particular the links that are now being made between symbiotic lifestyle and molecular evolution. Post-genomic and systems biology approaches are also emerging as powerful techniques to investigate host{\textendash}microbe interactions, both at the molecular level of the species interface and at the global scale. In parallel, next-generation sequencing technologies are allowing new questions to be addressed by providing access to population genomic data, as well as the much larger genomes of microbial eukaryotic symbionts and hosts. Throughout we describe the questions that these techniques are tackling and we conclude by listing a series of unanswered questions in microbial symbiosis that can potentially be addressed with the new technologies.},

abstract = {To determine the reproducibility and quantitation of the amplicon sequencing-based detection approach for analyzing microbial community structure, a total of 24 microbial communities from a long-term global change experimental site were examined. Genomic DNA obtained from each community was used to amplify 16S rRNA genes with two or three barcode tags as technical replicates in the presence of a small quantity (0.1% wt/wt) of genomic DNA from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 as the control. The technical reproducibility of the amplicon sequencing-based detection approach is quite low, with an average operational taxonomic unit (OTU) overlap of 17.2%{\textpm}2.3% between two technical replicates, and 8.2%{\textpm}2.3% among three technical replicates, which is most likely due to problems associated with random sampling processes. Such variations in technical replicates could have substantial effects on estimating $\beta$-diversity but less on $\alpha$-diversity. A high variation was also observed in the control across different samples (for example, 66.7-fold for the forward primer), suggesting that the amplicon sequencing-based detection approach could not be quantitative. In addition, various strategies were examined to improve the comparability of amplicon sequencing data, such as increasing biological replicates, and removing singleton sequences and less-representative OTUs across biological replicates. Finally, as expected, various statistical analyses with preprocessed experimental data revealed clear differences in the composition and structure of microbial communities between warming and non-warming, or between clipping and non-clipping. Taken together, these results suggest that amplicon sequencing-based detection is useful in analyzing microbial community structure even though it is not reproducible and quantitative. However, great caution should be taken in experimental design and data interpretation when the amplicon sequencing-based detection approach is used for quantitative analysis of the $\beta$-diversity of microbial communities.},

abstract = {Cnidarian bleaching is a breakdown in the mutualistic symbiosis between host Cnidarians, such as reef building corals, and their unicellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts. Bleaching is caused by a variety of environmental stressors, most notably elevated temperatures associated with global climate change in conjunction with high solar radiation, and it is a major contributor to coral death and reef degradation. This review examines the underlying cellular events that lead to symbiosis dysfunction and cause bleaching, emphasizing that, to date, we have only some pieces of a complex cellular jigsaw puzzle. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by damage to both photosynthetic and mitochondrial membranes, is shown to play a central role in both injury to the partners and to inter-partner communication of a stress response. Evidence is presented that suggests that bleaching is a host innate immune response to a compromised symbiont, much like innate immune responses in other host-microbe interactions. Finally, the elimination or exit of the symbiont from host tissues is described through a variety of mechanisms including exocytosis, host cell detachment and host cell apoptosis.},

abstract = {As the effects of climate change have become increasingly visible over the past three decades, coral reefs have suffered from a number of natural and anthropogenic disturbances that have caused a critical decline in coral populations. Among these disturbances are coral diseases, which have appeared with increasing frequency and severity, often in correlation with increases in water temperature. Although the crucial role played by Vibrio species in coral disease has been widely documented, the scientific community does not yet fully understand the infection process of Vibrio or its impact on coral physiology and immunology. Here, we investigated the physiological and transcriptomic responses of a major reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, when exposed to a specific pathogen (Vibrio coralliilyticus) under virulent (increasing water temperature) and non-virulent (constant low temperature) conditions. The infection process was examined by electron microscopy and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, and coral health was monitored by visual observations and measurements of zooxanthellar density. The results obtained suggest that coral tissue invasion occurs upon increasing water temperature only. Transcriptomic variations were investigated using a suppression-subtractive-hybridization approach, and the expression levels of six candidate immune-related genes were examined during bacterial exposure. These genes correspond to three lectin-like molecules putatively involved in the recognition of pathogens, two metal-binding proteins putatively involved in antibacterial response and one cystein protease inhibitor. The transcription patterns of these selected genes provide new insights into the responses of coral colonies to virulent versus non-virulent bacteria.},

RESULTS:UBLAST and USEARCH are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. They are often orders of magnitude faster than BLAST in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. UCLUST is a new clustering method that exploits USEARCH to assign sequences to clusters. UCLUST offers several advantages over the widely used program CD-HIT, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.

abstract = {Coral bleaching, the breakdown of the symbiotic relationship between host corals and their photosynthetic dinoflagellate endosymbionts, is a phenomenon of major ecological significance. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bleaching are poorly understood. Here we report substantial increases in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in symbionts associated with bleaching corals. Nitric oxide (NO), a product of NOS activity, is a highly reactive and membrane-permeable molecule that has the potential to exert cytotoxic effects in host cells either directly or in combination with molecular oxygen or superoxide radicals. This potential allows us to suggest that coral bleaching may be a stress response initiated by the symbiont, rather than by the host.},

abstract = {Many molecular studies describe how components of the proximal promoter affect transcriptional processes. However, these studies do not account for the likely effects of distant enhancers or chromatin structure, and thus it is difficult to conclude that the sequence variation in proximal promoters acts to modulate transcription in the natural context of the whole genome. This problem, the biological importance of proximal promoter sequence variation, can be addressed using a combination of molecular and evolutionary analyses. Provided here are molecular and evolutionary analyses of the variation in promoter function and sequence within and between populations of Fundulus heteroclitus for the lactate dehydrogenase-B (Ldh-B) proximal promoter. Approximately one third of the Ldh-B proximal promoter contains interspersed regions that are functionally important: (1) they bind transcription factors in vivo, (2) they effect a change in transcription as assayed by transient transfection into two different fish cell lines, and (3) they bind purified transcription factors in vitro. Evolutionary analyses that compare sequence variation in these functional regions versus the nonfunctional regions indicate that the changes in the Ldh-B proximal promoter sequences are due to directional selection. Thus, the Ldh-B proximal promoter sequence variations that affect transcriptional processes constitute a phenotypic change that is subject to natural selection, suggesting that proximal promoter sequence variation affects transcription in the natural context of the whole genome.},

To determine the mechanism of inorganic carbon transport by animal cells, we used plasma membrane vesicles prepared from ectodermal cells isolated from tentacles of the sea anemone, Anemonia viridis. H(14)CO(-)(3) uptake in the presence of an outward NaCl gradient or inward H(+) gradient, showed no evidence for a Cl(-)- or H(+)- driven HCO(-)(3) transport. H(14)CO(-)(3) and (36)Cl(-) uptakes were stimulated by a positive inside-membrane diffusion potential, suggesting the presence of HCO(-)(3) and Cl(-) conductances. A carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity was measured on plasma membrane (4%) and in the cytoplasm of the ectodermal cells (96%) and was sensitive to acetazolamide (IC(50) = 20 nM) and ethoxyzolamide (IC(50) = 2.5 nM). A strong DIDS-sensitive H(+)-ATPase activity was observed (IC(50) = 14 microM). This activity was also highly sensitive to vanadate and allyl isothiocyanate, two inhibitors of P-type H(+)-ATPases. Present data suggest that HCO(-)(3) absorption by ectodermal cells is carried out by H(+) secretion by H(+)-ATPase, resulting in the formation of carbonic acid in the surrounding seawater, which is quickly dehydrated into CO(2) by a membrane-bound CA. CO(2) then diffuses passively into the cell where it is hydrated in HCO(-)(3) by a cytosolic CA.},

We describe a method that can be used to assess coral pigmentation. This method is based on a correlation between the areal Chl a measurement and spectrophotometric analysis of a photographic slide of the same coral. Optical density values of the color slide are then converted into corresponding Chl a concentrations. This method can be used for the nondestructive assessment of chlorophyll concentration. A visual field bioassay based on this relationship is demonstrated. A laminated photograph of common corals of different shades of color and different chlorophyll content is used for the underwater evaluation of the pigmentation of living corals.},

This highly diverse group of fungi can have profound impacts on plant communities through increasing fitness by conferring abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, increasing biomass and decreasing water consumption, or decreasing fitness by altering resource allocation. Despite more than 100 yr of research resulting in thousands of journal articles, the ecological significance of these fungi remains poorly characterized. Historically, two endophytic groups (clavicipitaceous (C) and nonclavicipitaceous (NC)) have been discriminated based on phylogeny and life history traits. Here, we show that NC-endophytes represent three distinct functional groups based on host colonization and transmission, in planta biodiversity and fitness benefits conferred to hosts. Using this framework, we contrast the life histories, interactions with hosts and potential roles in plant ecophysiology of C-and NC-endophytes, and highlight several key questions for future work in endophyte biology.},

abstract = {Modulated chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to examine the effects of cyanide (NaCN) from cyanide fishing on photosynthesis of the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) located within the tissues of the zooxanthellate hard coral Plesiastrea versipora. Incubating corals for 3 h in a cyanide concentration of >10(-5) M NaCN under a saturating light intensity (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR] intensity of 250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) caused a long-term decrease in the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (dark-adapted F-v/F-m). The effect of cyanide on dark-adapted F-v/F-m was Light dependent; thus F-v/F-m only decreased in corals exposed to 10(-4) M NaCN for 3 h under PAR of 250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). In corals where dark-adapted F-v/F-m was significantly lowered by cyanide exposure, we observed significant loss of zooxanthellae from the tissues. causing the corals to discolour (bleach). To further examine the light-dependent effect of cyanide and its relation to loss of zooxanthellae, corals were exposed to 10-4 M NaCN or seawater only (control), either in darkness or under 250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). ill significant decrease in dark-adapted F-v/F-m and loss of zooxanthellae only occurred in corals exposed to cyanide in the light. These results suggest cyanide causes the dissociation of the symbiosis (bleaching) by affecting photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae. Quenching analysis using the saturation-pulse technique revealed the development of high levels of non-photochemical quenching in cyanide-exposed coral. This result is consistent with the known property of cyanide as an inhibitor of the dark reactions of the Calvin cycle, specifically as an inhibitor of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Therefore, chronic photoinhibition and an impairment of photosynthesis of zooxanthellae provides an important 'signal' to examine the environmental effects of cyanide fishing during controlled releases in situ.},

abstract = {Although Acropora is the most species-rich genus of the scleractinian (stony) corals, only three species occur in the Caribbean: A. cervicornis, A. palmata and A. prolifera. Based on overall coral morphology, abundance and distribution patterns, it has been suggested that A. prolifera may be a hybrid between A. cervicornis and A. palmata. The species boundaries among these three morphospecies were examined using DNA sequence analyses of the nuclear Pax-C 46/47 intron and the ribosomal DNA Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS1 and ITS2) and 5.8S regions. Moderate levels of sequence variability were observed in the ITS and 5.8S sequences (up to 5.2% overall sequence difference), but variability within species was as large as between species and all three species carried similar sequences. Since this is unlikely to represent a shared ancestral polymorphism, the data suggest that introgressive hybridization occurs among the three species. For the Pax-C intron, A. cervicornis and A. palmata had very distinct allele frequencies and A. cervicornis carried a unique allele at a frequency of 0.769 (although sequence differences between alleles were small). All A. prolifera colonies examined were heterozygous for the Pax-C intron, whereas heterozygosity was only 0.286 and 0.333 for A. cervicornis and A. palmata, respectively. These data support the hypothesis that A. prolifera is the product of hybridization between two species that have a different allelic composition for the Pax-C intron, i.e. A. cervicornis and A. palmata. We therefore suggest that A. prolifera is a hybrid between A. cervicornis and A. palmata, which backcrosses with the parental species at low frequency.},

Therefore, reefs isolated by distance or current patterns are thought to be highly vulnerable to catastrophic disturbance. We found that on an isolated reef system in north Western Australia, coral cover increased from 9% to 44% within 12 years of a coral bleaching event, despite a 94% reduction in larval supply for 6 years after the bleaching. The initial increase in coral cover was the result of high rates of growth and survival of remnant colonies, followed by a rapid increase in juvenile recruitment as colonies matured. We show that isolated reefs can recover from major disturbance, and that the benefits of their isolation from chronic anthropogenic pressures can outweigh the costs of limited connectivity.},

abstract = {Evaluating the response of organisms to stress assumes that functional benchmarks are available against which the response can be gauged, but this expectation remains unfulfilled for many taxa. As a result, attempts to describe the organismic effects of environmental degradation and physiological stress can prove misleading. Functional benchmarks and the effects of stress are particularly germane to coral reefs that globally are exposed to significant environmental challenges, and in this study, we compiled data on scleractinian corals to describe a reference against which stress responses can be gauged. Based on this construct, we tested the veracity of well-established contrasts--involving differences in physiological function among depths and families--to evaluate the capacity of available data to support synthetic analyses. Our analysis used 126 papers describing 37 genera, and at least 73 species, and described 13 traits, first independent of depth, and second, by depth. Data appropriate for these analyses were so sparse that depth- and family-level effects were inconspicuous, although the depth contrast revealed a decline in dark respiration and an increase in calcification (both normalized to area) in deeper water. Our analyses of scleractinian literature revealed limitations of the data available for synthetic analyses, as well for describing functional benchmarks within this taxon. We attribute some of these effects to differences in the physical environment under which measurements were made, and suspect that such problems are commonplace for other taxa. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models provide one means to overcome some of these problems, and they can be used for any taxon to quantitatively summarize data for comparative analyses of stressor responses. The suitability of these models is illustrated for scleractinian corals by predicting from first principles the ratio of Symbiodinium to holobiont carbon and the respiration.},

abstract = {As large volumes of omics data have become available, systems biology is playing increasingly important roles in elucidating new biological phenomena, especially through genome-scale metabolic network modeling and simulation. Much effort has been exerted on integrating omics data with metabolic flux simulation, but further development is necessary for more accurate flux estimation. To move one step forward, we adopted the concept of flux-coupled genes (FCGs), which show that their expression transition patterns upon perturbations are correlated with their corresponding flux values, as additional constraints in metabolic flux analysis. It was found that gnd, pfkB, rpe, sdhB, sdhD, sucA, and zwf genes, mostly associated with pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle, were the most consistent FCGs in Escherichia coli based on its transcriptome and (13) C-flux data obtained from the chemostat cultivation at five different dilution rates. Consequently, constraints-based flux analyses with FCGs as additional constraints were conducted for the seven single-gene knockout mutants, compared with those obtained without using FCGs. This strategy of constraining the metabolic flux analysis with FCGs is expected to be useful due to the relative ease in obtaining transcriptional information in the functional genomics era.},

This will not only enable a better identification of diversity patterns, but will also shed more light on the associated environmental conditions, spatial locations, and seasonal fluctuations, which could explain such patterns. Complex ecological questions may now be addressed using multivariate statistical analyses, which represent a vast potential of techniques that are still underexploited. Here, well-established exploratory and hypothesis-driven approaches are reviewed, so as to foster their addition to the microbial ecologist toolbox. Because such tools aim at reducing data set complexity, at identifying major patterns and putative causal factors, they will certainly find many applications in microbial ecology.},

abstract = {Intracellular habitats have been invaded by a remarkable diversity of organisms, and strategies employed to successfully reside in another species{\textquoteright} cellular space are varied. Common selective pressures may be experienced in symbioses involving phototrophic symbionts and heterotrophic hosts. Here I refine and elaborate the Arrested Phagosome Hypothesis that proposes a mechanism that phototrophs use to gain access to their host{\textquoteright}s intracellular habitat. I employ the economic concept of production possibility frontiers (PPF) as a useful heuristic to clearly define the trade-offs that an intracellular phototroph is likely to face as it allocates photosynthetically-derived pools of energy. Fixed carbon can fuel basic metabolism/respiration, it can support mitotic division, or it can be translocated to the host. Excess photosynthate can be stored for future use. Thus, gross photosynthetic productivity can be divided among these four general categories, and natural selection will favor phenotypes that best match the demands presented to the symbiont by the host cellular habitat. The PPF highlights trade-offs that exist between investment in growth (i.e., mitosis) or residency (i.e., translocating material to the host). Insights gained from this perspective might help explain phenomena such as coral bleaching because deficits in photosynthetic production are likely to diminish a symbiont{\textquoteright}s ability to {\textquotedblleft}afford{\textquotedblright} the costs of intracellular residency. I highlight deficits in our current understanding of host:symbiont interactions at the molecular, genetic, and cellular level, and I also discuss how semantic differences among scientists working with different symbiont systems may diminish the rate of increase in our understanding of phototrophic-based associations. I argue that adopting interdisciplinary (in this case, inter-symbiont-system) perspectives will lead to advances in our general understanding of the phototrophic symbiont{\textquoteright}s intracellular niche.},

This review examines a model system for the study of such symbioses, the light organ association between the bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes and the marine luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Specifically, the initiation, establishment, and persistence of the benign bacterial infection of the juvenile host light organ are described, as are efforts to understand the mechanisms underlying this specific colonization program. Using molecular genetic techniques, mutant strains of V. fischeri have been constructed that are defective at specific stages of the development of the association. Some of the lessons that these mutants have begun to teach us about the complex and long-term nature of this cooperative venture are summarized.},

abstract = {Bleaching - the loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) from animals normally possessing them - can be induced by a variety of stresses, of which temperature has received the most attention. Bleaching is generally considered detrimental, but Buddemeier and Fautin have proposed that bleaching is also adaptive, providing an opportunity for recombining hosts with alternative algal types to form symbioses that might be better adapted to altered circumstances. Our mathematical model of this ''adaptive bleaching hypothesis'' provides insight into how animal-algae symbioses might react under various circumstances. It emulates many aspects of the coral bleaching phenomenon including: corals bleaching in response to a temperature only slightly greater than their average local maximum temperature; background bleaching; bleaching events being followed by bleaching of lesser magnitude in the subsequent one to several years; higher thermal tolerance of corals subject to environmental variability compared with those living under more constant conditions; patchiness in bleaching; and bleaching at temperatures that had not previously resulted in bleaching.},

abstract = {We have mapped and quantified mouse transcriptomes by deeply sequencing them and recording how frequently each gene is represented in the sequence sample (RNA-Seq). This provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. We report reference measurements composed of 41-52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

Goods are divided into renewable resources and reef mining. Ecological services are classified into physical structure services, biotic services, biogeochemical services, information services, and social/cultural services. A review of economic valuation studies reveals that only a few of the goods and services of reefs have been captured. We synthesize current understanding of the relationships between ecological services and functional groups of species and biological communities of coral reefs in different regions of the world. The consequences of human impacts on coral reefs are also discussed, including loss of resilience, or buffer capacity. Such loss may impair the capacity for recovery of coral reefs and as a consequence the quality and quantity of their delivery of ecological goods and services. Conserving the capacity of reefs to generate essential services requires that they are managed as components of a larger seascape-landscape of which human activities are seen as integrated parts.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that mutualisms often have variable outcomes in space and time. In particular, the outcomes may be dependent on the density of the partners with unimodal or saturating outcomes providing stability to the mutualism. We examine density-dependent outcomes of an obligate, species-specific mutualism between a South African carnivorous plant (Roridula dentata) and a hemipteran (Pameridea) that facilitates prey digestion, but also sucks plant sap. Plants occur in sandy, leached, nitrogen-poor soils and have no digestive enzymes to digest prey. Instead they rely on obligately dependent hemipterans to supply nitrogen by digesting prey for them and defecating on their leaves. We documented the densities of Pameridea on Roridula in the field. In the greenhouse, we manipulated the hemipteran densities on Roridula and measured the mean relative growth rates of plants with differing hemipteran densities. Plants exhibited a unimodal response to the density of their mutualist partners. Those with no hemipterans had negative growth rates, suggesting that hemipterans are important in facilitating nitrogen absorption. Plants with intermediate hemipteran densities had positive growth rates but growth rates were negative under very high hemipteran densities. Our research provides support for variable and unimodal outcomes in mutualism. Unimodal outcomes may be particularly important in obligate mutualisms and this is one of the few studied outside of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms. In this system, extrinsic factors such as other predators may affect the mutualism by altering the numbers of hemipterans.},

abstract = {Pyrosequencing technologies have revolutionized how we describe and compare complex microbial communities. In 454 pyrosequencing data sets, the abundance of reads pertaining to taxa or phylotypes is commonly interpreted as a measure of genic or taxon abundance, useful for quantitative comparisons of community similarity. Potentially systematic biases inherent in sample processing, amplification and sequencing, however, may alter read abundance and reduce the utility of quantitative metrics. Here, we examine the relationship between read abundance and biological abundance in a sample of house dust spiked with known quantities and identities of fungi along a dilution gradient. Our results show one order of magnitude differences in read abundance among species. Precision of quantification within species along the dilution gradient varied from R(2) of 0.96-0.54. Read-quality based processing stringency profoundly affected the abundance of one species containing long homopolymers in a read orientation-biased manner. Order-level composition of background environmental fungal communities determined from pyrosequencing data was comparable with that derived from cloning and Sanger sequencing and was not biased by read orientation. We conclude that read abundance is approximately quantitative within species, but between-species comparisons can be biased by innate sequence structure. Our results showed a trade off between sequence quality stringency and quantification. Careful consideration of sequence processing methods and community analyses are warranted when testing hypotheses using read abundance data.},

abstract = {1. Heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) expression has been investigated in a species of tropical reef coral, Goniopora djibouliensis from a subtidal habitat, following temperature treatments and transplantation to the intertidal reef zone.2. Levels of hsp 70 were found to increase markedly in G. dijboutiensis following 2 h heat shocks at 33 degrees C, 36 degrees C, 38 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Transplantation of G. djiboutiensis from the subtidal habitat to the intertidal habitat for 16 and 32 days resulted in elevated constitutive levels of hsp 70 compared with control colonies.3. Whole organism responses to heat shock were assessed by quantifying zooxanthellae density and the chlorophyll pigment content of zooxanthellae cells. Heat shock elicited a significant loss of zooxantheliae (p < 0.01).4. The loss of zooxanthellae from G. djibouliensis at lower heat shock temperatures (30 degrees C) than those required to stimulate hsp 70 induction (33 degrees C) in G. djiboutiensis suggests that zooxantheliae may be more thermally sensitive than the host.

abstract = {Recent reports of contamination of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by herbicides used in antifouling paints and in agriculture have caused concern over the possible effects on corals in nearshore areas. Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to examine changes in the maximum effective quantum yield (DeltaF/F-m') of symbiotic dinoflagellates within the host tissues (in hospite) of the coral Seriatopora hystrix exposed to a number of Photosystem 11 (PSII) inhibiting herbicides in short-term toxicity tests. The concentration of herbicide required to reduce DeltaF/F-m' by 50% (median effective concentration [EC50]) differed by over 2 orders of magnitude: Irgarol 1051 (0.7 mug l(-1)) > ametryn (1.7 mug l(-1)) > diuron (2.3 mug l(-1)) > hexazinone (8.8 mug l(-1)) > atrazine (45 mug l(-1)) > simazine (150 mug l(-1)) > tebuthiuron (175 mug l(-1)) > ionynil (>1 mg l(-1)). Similar absolute and relative toxicities were observed with colonies of the coral Acropora formosa (Irgarol 1051 EC50: 1.3 mug l(-1), diuron EC50: 2.8 mug l(-1)). Time-course experiments indicated that DeltaF/F-m' was rapidly reduced (i.e. within minutes) in S. hystrix exposed to Irgarol 1051 and diuron. On return to fresh running seawater, DeltaF/F-m' recovered quickly in diuron-exposed corals (i.e. in minutes to hours), but slowly in corals exposed to Irgarol 1051 (i.e. hours to days). Time-course experiments indicated that the effects of diuron (3 mug l(-1)) on S. hystrix were inversely related to temperature over the range 20 to 30degreesC, although initially the effects were less at the lower temperatures. Repeated exposure to pulses of Irgarol 1051 (daily 2 h exposure to 30 mug l(-1) over 4 d) resulted in a 30% decrease in the density of symbiotic dinoflagellates in the tissues of S. hystrix.},

abstract = {Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the 'rare biosphere', is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli MG1655 as a reference template, we find that 16S rDNA diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of 16S pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are in global decline, converting from dominance by coral to dominance by seaweed. Once seaweeds become abundant, coral recovery is suppressed unless herbivores return to remove seaweeds, and corals then recruit. Variance in the recovery of fishes and corals is not well understood. We show that juveniles of both corals and fishes are repelled by chemical cues from fished, seaweed-dominated reefs but attracted to cues from coral-dominated areas where fishing is prohibited. Chemical cues of specific seaweeds from degraded reefs repulsed recruits, and cues from specific corals that are typical of healthy reefs attracted recruits. Juveniles were present at but behaviorally avoided recruiting to degraded reefs dominated by seaweeds. For recovery, degraded reefs may need to be managed to produce cues that attract, rather than repel, recruiting corals and fishes.},

The absolute stereochemistry was determined from the specific rotation of the perhydro derivative. The distribution of ZL within several Symbiodinium isolates was quantitatively analyzed by HPLC techniques and suggested a relationship between the productivity of this metabolite and the Symbiodinium phylogeny. The cytotoxicity of ZL was evaluated by using human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines in comparison with that of DHA and other common fatty acids, suggesting that the long unsaturated chain was important rather than the gamma-lactone moiety.},

abstract = {Background: Fish melanocytes aggregate or disperse their melanosomes in response to the level of intracellular cAMP. The role of cAMP is to regulate both melanosome travel along microtubules and their transfer between microtubules and actin. The factors that are downstream of cAMP and that directly modulate the motors responsible for melanosome transport are not known. To identify these factors, we are characterizing melanosome transport mutants in zebrafish. Results: We report that a mutation (allele j120) in the gene encoding zebrafish melanophilin (Mlpha) interferes with melanosome dispersion downstream of cAMP. Based on mouse genetics, the current model of melanophilin function is that melanophilin links myosin V to melanosomes. The residues responsible for this function are conserved in the zebrafish ortholog. However, if linking myosin V to melanosomes was Mlpha's sole function, elevated cAMP would cause mlphaj(120) mutant melanocytes to hyperdisperse their melanosomes. Yet this is not what we observe. Instead, mutant melanocytes disperse their melanosomes much more slowly than normal and less than halfway to the cell margin. This defect is caused by a failure to suppress minus-end (dynein) motility along microtubules, as shown by tracking individual melanosomes. Disrupting the actin cytoskeleton, which causes wild-type melanocytes to hyperdisperse their melanosomes, does not affect dispersion in mutant melanocytes. Therefore, Mlpha regulates dynein independently of its putative linkage to myosin V. Conclusions: We propose that cAMP-induced melanosome dispersion depends on the actin-independent suppression of dynein by Mlpha and that Mlpha coordinates the early outward movement of melanosomes along microtubules and their later transfer to actin filaments.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) is a relatively young yet rapidly developing scientific field. Assessing the potential response(s) of marine organisms to projected near-future OA scenarios has been at the forefront of scientific research, with a focus on ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs) and processes (e.g., calcification) that are deemed particularly vulnerable. Recently, a heightened emphasis has been placed on evaluating early life history stages as these stages are generally perceived to be more sensitive to environmental change. The number of acidification-related studies focused on early life stages has risen dramatically over the last several years. While early life history stages of corals have been understudied compared to other marine invertebrate taxa (e.g., echinoderms, mollusks), numerous studies exist to contribute to our status of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of OA on coral recruitment dynamics. To synthesize this information, the present paper reviews the primary literature on the effects of acidification on sexual reproduction and early stages of corals, incorporating lessons learned from more thoroughly studied taxa to both assess our current understanding of the potential impacts of OA on coral recruitment and to inform and guide future research in this area.},

Symbionts can be vertically transmitted from host parent to offspring or they can be acquired horizontally from the surrounding environment with each new host generation. Cnidarian-algal symbioses, the subject of our study, exhibit both strategies. We investigated the clade identity of symbionts in soft coral hosts (Eilat, Red Sea) in relation to their hosts' mode of symbiont acquisition. We found for the first time that all hosts using horizontal transmission harbored symbionts belonging to Clade C while those with vertical transmission uniquely harbored symbionts from Clade A. The latter, capable of coping with a wide array of environmental conditions, evolved to be optimal vertically transmitted symbionts. The limitation of Clade A symbionts to hosts with vertical transmission suggests a coevolution of the hosts and symbionts. Clade C symbionts, characterized by large sub-clade variability, are found in corals with horizontal transmission and, most probably, each of its genotypes exhibits a more specialized set of physiological capabilities.},

abstract = {Discovering how corals can adjust their thermal sensitivity in the context of global climate change is important in understanding the long-term persistence of coral reefs. In this study, we showed that short-term preconditioning to higher temperatures, 3{\textdegree}C below the experimentally determined bleaching threshold, for a period of 10 days provides thermal tolerance for the symbiosis stability between the scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora and Symbiodinium. Based on genotypic analysis, our results indicate that the acclimatization of this coral species to thermal stress does not come down to simple changes in Symbiodinium and/or the bacterial communities that associate with reef-building corals. This suggests that the physiological plasticity of the host and/or symbiotic components appears to play an important role in responding to ocean warming. The further study of host and symbiont physiology, both of Symbiodinium and prokaryotes, is of paramount importance in the context of global climate change, as mechanisms for rapid holobiont acclimatization will become increasingly important to the long-standing persistence of coral reefs.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a threat to marine species worldwide, and forecasting the ecological impacts of acidification is a high priority for science, management, and policy. As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification in multi-species assemblages, suggesting that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single-species laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other factors, such as nutritional status or source population, could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses. Last, the results highlight a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to acidification when taxa are concurrently exposed to elevated seawater temperature.},

Still, many IBMs are data hungry, species specific, and time-consuming to develop and analyze. Many of these issues would be resolved by using general theories of individual dynamics as the basis for IBMs. While such theories have frequently been examined at the individual level, few cross-level tests exist that also try to predict population dynamics. Here we performed a cross-level test of dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory by parameterizing an individual-based model using individual-level data of the water flea, Daphnia magna, and comparing the emerging population dynamics to independent data from population experiments. We found that DEB theory successfully predicted population growth rates and peak densities but failed to capture the decline phase. Further assumptions on food-dependent mortality of juveniles were needed to capture the population dynamics after ...},

abstract = {Climate change-driven stressors threaten the persistence of coral reefs worldwide. Symbiotic relationships between scleractinian corals and photosynthetic endosymbionts (genus Symbiodinium) are the foundation of reef ecosystems, and these associations are differentially impacted by stress. Here, we couple empirical data from the coral reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia, and a network theoretic modeling approach to evaluate how patterns in coral-Symbiodinium associations influence community stability under climate change. To introduce the effect of climate perturbations, we simulate local 'extinctions' that represent either the loss of coral species or the ability to engage in symbiotic interactions. Community stability is measured by determining the duration and number of species that persist through the simulated extinctions. Our results suggest that four factors greatly increase coral-Symbiodinium community stability in response to global changes: (i) the survival of generalist hosts and symbionts maximizes potential symbiotic unions; (ii) elevated symbiont diversity provides redundant or complementary symbiotic functions; (iii) compatible symbiotic assemblages create the potential for local recolonization; and (iv) the persistence of certain traits associate with symbiotic diversity and redundancy. Symbiodinium may facilitate coral persistence through novel environmental regimes, but this capacity is mediated by symbiotic specificity, association patterns, and the functional performance of the symbionts. Our model-based approach identifies general trends and testable hypotheses in coral-Symbiodinium community responses. Future studies should consider similar methods when community size and/or environmental complexity preclude experimental approaches.},

Gene frequency surfaces generated by a simulation of Wright's isolation-by-distance model were shown to exhibit spatial autocorrelation, except in the panmictic case. Identical stochastic generating processes result in surfaces with characteristics that are functions of the process parameters, such as parental vagility and neighborhood size. Differences in these parameters are detectable as differences in spatial autocorrelations after only a few generations of the simulations. Separate realizations of processes with identical parameters yield similar spatial correlograms. We have examined the inferences about population structure that could have been made from these observations if they had been real, rather than simulated, populations. From such inferences, we could have drawn conclusions about the presence of selection, migration and drift in given natural systems.},

This study used real-time PCR to monitor the transcript abundance of two important photosynthetic reaction center genes, psbA (encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) and psaA (encoding the P(700) protein of photosystem I), in four cultured isolates (representing ITS2-types A13, A20, B1, and F2) and two in hospite Symbiodinium spp. within the coral Pocillopora spp. (ITS2-types C1b-c and D1). Both cultured and in hospite Symbiodinium samples were exposed to elevated temperatures (32{\textdegree}C) over a 7-day period and examined for changes in photochemistry and transcript abundance. Symbiodinium A13 and C1b-c (both thermally sensitive) demonstrated significant declines in both psbA and psaA during the thermal stress treatment, whereas the transcript levels of the other Symbiodinium types remained stable. The downregulation of both core photosystem genes could be the result of several different physiological mechanisms, but may ultimately limit repair rates of photosynthetic proteins, rendering some Symbiodinium spp. especially susceptible to thermal stress.},

abstract = {Shipboard experiments were performed over a two day period to examine the proteomic response of the symbiotic coral Acropora microphthalma exposed to acute conditions of high temperature / low light or high light / low temperature stress. During these treatments, corals had noticeably bleached. The photosynthetic performance of residual algal endosymbionts was severely impaired but showed signs of recovery in both treatments by the end of the second day. Changes in the coral proteome were determined daily and, using recently available annotated genome sequences, the individual contributions of the coral host and algal endosymbionts could be extracted from these data. Quantitative changes in proteins relevant to redox state and calcium metabolism are presented. Notably, expression of common antioxidant proteins was not detected from the coral host but present in the algal endosymbiont proteome. Possible roles for elevated carbonic anhydrase in the coral host are considered: to restore intracellular pH diminished by loss of photosynthetic activity, to indirectly limit intracellular calcium influx linked with enhanced calmodulin expression; to impede late-stage symbiont exocytosis, or to enhance inorganic carbon transport to improve the photosynthetic performance of algal symbionts that remain in hospite. Protein effectors of calcium-dependent exocytosis were present in both symbiotic partners. No caspase-family proteins associated with host cell apoptosis, with exception of the autophagy chaperone HSP70, were detected suggesting that algal loss and photosynthetic dysfunction under these experimental conditions were not due to host-mediated phytosymbiont destruction. Instead, bleaching occurs by symbiont exocytosis and loss of light-harvesting pigments of algae that remain in hospite. These proteomic data are, therefore, consistent with our premise that coral endosymbionts can mediate their own retention or exit from the coral host, which may manifest as 'symbiont shuffling' of Symbiodinium clades in response to environmental stress.},

The common use of machine-assigned quality scores on next generation platforms does not necessarily correlate with accuracy. Here, we describe using the overlap of paired-end, short sequence reads to identify error-prone reads in marker gene analyses and their contribution to spurious OTUs following clustering analysis using QIIME. Our approach can also reduce error in shotgun sequencing data generated from libraries with small, tightly constrained insert sizes.

abstract = {Coral bleaching events threaten the sustainability of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Here we show that bleaching events of the past three decades have been mitigated by induced thermal tolerance of reef-building corals, and this protective mechanism is likely to be lost under near-future climate change scenarios. We show that 75% of past thermal stress events have been characterized by a temperature trajectory that subjects corals to a protective, sub-bleaching stress, before reaching temperatures that cause bleaching. Such conditions confer thermal tolerance, decreasing coral cell mortality and symbiont loss during bleaching by over 50%. We find that near-future increases in local temperature of as little as 0.5{\textdegree}C result in this protective mechanism being lost, which may increase the rate of degradation of the GBR.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change compromises reef growth as a result of increasing temperatures and ocean acidification. Scleractinian corals vary in their sensitivity to these variables, suggesting species composition will influence how reef communities respond to future climate change. Because data are lacking for many species, most studies that model future reef growth rely on uniform scleractinian calcification sensitivities to temperature and ocean acidification. To address this knowledge gap, calcification of twelve common and understudied Caribbean coral species was measured for two months under crossed temperatures (27, 30.3~{\textdegree}C) and CO2 partial pressures (pCO2 ) (400, 900, 1300~$\mu$atm). Mixed-effects models of calcification for each species were then used to project community-level scleractinian calcification using Florida Keys reef composition data and IPCC AR5 ensemble climate model data. Three of the four most abundant species, Orbicella faveolata, Montastraea cavernosa, and Porites astreoides, had negative calcification responses to both elevated temperature and pCO2 . In the business-as-usual CO2 emissions scenario, reefs with high abundances of these species had projected end-of-century declines in scleractinian calcification of >50% relative to present-day rates. Siderastrea siderea, the other most common species, was insensitive to both temperature and pCO2 within the levels tested here. Reefs dominated by this species had the most stable end-of-century growth. Under more optimistic scenarios of reduced CO2 emissions, calcification rates throughout the Florida Keys declined <20% by 2100. Under the most extreme emissions scenario, projected declines were highly variable among reefs, ranging 10-100%. Without considering bleaching, reef growth will likely decline on most reefs, especially where resistant species like S.~siderea are not already dominant. This study demonstrates how species composition influences reef community responses to climate change and how reduced CO2 emissions can limit future declines in reef calcification.},

abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing of cDNA has enabled deep and efficient probing of transcriptomes. Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

abstract = {The evolution of organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis paralleled a long-term reduction in atmospheric CO2 and the increase in O2. Consequently, the competition between O2 and CO2 for the active sites of RUBISCO became more and more restrictive to the rate of photosynthesis. In coping with this situation, many algae and some higher plants acquired mechanisms that use energy to increase the CO2 concentrations (CO2 concentrating mechanisms, CCMs) in the proximity of RUBISCO. A number of CCM variants are now found among the different groups of algae. Modulating the CCMs may be crucial in the energetic and nutritional budgets of a cell, and a multitude of environmental factors can exert regulatory effects on the expression of the CCM components. We discuss the diversity of CCMs, their evolutionary origins, and the role of the environment in CCM modulation.},

abstract = {Mounding corals survive bleaching events in greater numbers than branching corals. However, no study to date has determined the underlying physiological and biogeochemical trait(s) that are responsible for mounding coral holobiont resilience to bleaching. Furthermore, the potential of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a source of fixed carbon to bleached corals has never been determined. Here, Porites lobata corals were experimentally bleached for 23 days and then allowed to recover for 0, 1, 5, and 11 months. At each recovery interval a suite of analyses were performed to assess their recovery (photosynthesis, respiration, chlorophyll a , energy reserves, tissue biomass, calcification, $\delta$ 13 C of the skeletal, $\delta$ 13 C, and $\delta$ 15 N of the animal host and endosymbiont fractions). Furthermore, at 0 months of recovery, the assimilation of photosynthetically acquired and zooplankton-feeding acquired carbon into the animal host, endosymbiont, skeleton, and coral-mediated DOC were measured via 13 C-pulse-chase labeling. During the first month of recovery, energy reserves and tissue biomass in bleached corals were maintained despite reductions in chlorophyll a , photosynthesis, and the assimilation of photosynthetically fixed carbon. At the same time, P. lobata corals catabolized carbon acquired from zooplankton and seemed to take up DOC as a source of fixed carbon. All variables that were negatively affected by bleaching recovered within 5 to 11 months. Thus, bleaching resilience in the mounding coral P. lobata is driven by its ability to actively catabolize zooplankton-acquired carbon and seemingly utilize DOC as a significant fixed carbon source, facilitating the maintenance of energy reserves and tissue biomass. With the frequency and intensity of bleaching events expected to increase over the next century, coral diversity on future reefs may favor not only mounding morphologies but species like P. lobata , which have the ability to utilize heterotrophic sources of fixed carbon that minimize the impact of bleaching and promote fast recovery.},

abstract = {The capacity of reef-building corals to associate with environmentally-appropriate types of endosymbionts from the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium contributes significantly to their success at local scales. Additionally, some corals are able to acclimatize to environmental perturbations by shuffling the relative proportions of different Symbiodinium types hosted. Understanding the dynamics of these symbioses requires a sensitive and quantitative method of Symbiodinium genotyping. Electrophoresis methods, still widely utilized for this purpose, are predominantly qualitative and cannot guarantee detection of a background type below 10% of the total Symbiodinium population. Here, the relative abundances of four Symbiodinium types (A13, C1, C3, and D1) in mixed samples of known composition were quantified using deep sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal RNA gene (ITS-2) by means of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using Roche 454. In samples dominated by each of the four Symbiodinium types tested, background levels of the other three types were detected when present at 5%, 1%, and 0.1% levels, and their relative abundances were quantified with high (A13, C1, D1) to variable (C3) accuracy. The potential of this deep sequencing method for resolving fine-scale genetic diversity within a symbiont type was further demonstrated in a natural symbiosis using ITS-1, and uncovered reef-specific differences in the composition of Symbiodinium microadriaticum in two species of acroporid corals (Acropora digitifera and A. hyacinthus) from Palau. The ability of deep sequencing of the ITS locus (1 and 2) to detect and quantify low-abundant Symbiodinium types, as well as finer-scale diversity below the type level, will enable more robust quantification of local genetic diversity in Symbiodinium populations. This method will help to elucidate the role that background types have in maximizing coral fitness across diverse environments and in response to environmental change.},

This study compared aspects of the coral/zooxanthellae symbiosis in species and genera that suffered either high or low mortality during a bleaching event. These characteristics were assessed in Okinawa between March and June 1999, 5-10 months after the bleaching event there in August-September 1998. Species with low mortality rates generally had higher densities of zooxanthellae per square centimeter and a very low rate of release of degraded zooxanthellae. Low-mortality species also had more total coral tissue per square centimeter of coral surface area. The size of zooxanthellae varied little among species. The differences in these characteristics among coral species suggest that the symbiotic relationship operates very differently among coral species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In invertebrates, genes belonging to dynamically regulated functional categories appear to be less methylated than "housekeeping" genes, suggesting that DNA methylation may modulate gene expression plasticity. To date, however, experimental evidence to support this hypothesis across different natural habitats has been lacking.

RESULTS:Gene expression profiles were generated from 30 pairs of genetically identical fragments of coral Acropora millepora reciprocally transplanted between distinct natural habitats for 3 months. Gene expression was analyzed in the context of normalized CpG content, a well-established signature of historical germline DNA methylation. Genes with weak methylation signatures were more likely to demonstrate differential expression based on both transplant environment and population of origin than genes with strong methylation signatures. Moreover, the magnitude of expression differences due to environment and population were greater for genes with weak methylation signatures.

CONCLUSIONS:Our results support a connection between differential germline methylation and gene expression flexibility across environments and populations. Studies of phylogenetically basal invertebrates such as corals will further elucidate the fundamental functional aspects of gene body methylation in Metazoa.},

abstract = {The symbiosis between cnidarians (e.g., corals or sea anemones) and intracellular dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium is of immense ecological importance. In particular, this symbiosis promotes the growth and survival of reef corals in nutrient-poor tropical waters; indeed, coral reefs could not exist without this symbiosis. However, our fundamental understanding of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis and of its links to coral calcification remains poor. Here we review what we currently know about the cell biology of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. In doing so, we aim to refocus attention on fundamental cellular aspects that have been somewhat neglected since the early to mid-1980s, when a more ecological approach began to dominate. We review the four major processes that we believe underlie the various phases of establishment and persistence in the cnidarian/coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis: (i) recognition and phagocytosis, (ii) regulation of host-symbiont biomass, (iii) metabolic exchange and nutrient trafficking, and (iv) calcification. Where appropriate, we draw upon examples from a range of cnidarian-alga symbioses, including the symbiosis between green Hydra and its intracellular chlorophyte symbiont, which has considerable potential to inform our understanding of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Ultimately, we provide a comprehensive overview of the history of the field, its current status, and where it should be going in the future.},
